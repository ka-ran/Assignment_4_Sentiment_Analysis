CBC;Be careful what you sign: Ontario man fighting for home after private mortgage gone wrong;"A Markham, Ont., man is struggling to hold on to the home where he's lived for 15 years after he signed on to a high-interest mortgage with a private lending company that is now pursuing him in court for not making payments.Mississauga-based Morex Capital initiated court proceedings earlier this year to take control of the home through power of sale, but has since changed tack after CBC News began asking questions about the situation.The company's lawyer now says it's willing to negotiate with 44-year-old Christian Brooks to reduce the amount owing on the $195,000 mortgage that has ballooned to $248,000.Brooks went to the alternative lender seeking a loan in 2019 because he thought it was his only option.The freelance graphic designer had a low credit score, bills to pay and a collections agency was after him. Tax returns show his annual income at the time was slightly more than $7,000, excluding savings.""It was my first time doing something like this,"" said Brooks. ""It was out of desperation.""I had no choice but to take it because I was already in financial debt. - Christian Brooks on signing a mortgage with Morex CapitalThis type of mortgage — funded by private investors that have pooled money to offer loans in exchange for a return on investment — has become more common in Canada. Borrowers should be aware, it's often not subject to the same kind of lending conditions as a traditional mortgage offered by a chartered bank.Mortgage carried 10.49% interest rateAn acquaintance referred him to Morex Capital, a company that invests in ""high yielding, short-term first and second residential Ontario mortgages,"" according to its website.Brooks wasn't buying the detached bungalow on Cheeseman Drive, it already belonged to his grandmother. Brooks says he was mostly raised by her and has lived alone at the home since she moved to a nursing home several years ago.He is a joint tenant on the title, meaning he would inherit the property upon his grandmother's death, and has power of attorney for her property, which he used to sign for her.In June 2019, Brooks took out a loan against the $800,000 house in the form of a one-year, $195,000 mortgage with a 10.49 per cent interest rate, according to the signed mortgage commitment reviewed by CBC News.Although he borrowed $195,000, Morex Capital provided $148,000 after fees and payouts.According to the mortgage document, the fees included a $29,000 payment to an individual who Brooks says he doesn't know, an $8,000 administration fee, a $4,000 broker fee and an annual renewal fee of up to $8,000, along with other potential charges for late payments and lawyers in case of default.Brooks willingly signed.""I agreed to it because of the situation I was in,"" he said. ""I had no choice but to take it because I was already in financial debt.""He says his goal was to build back his credit, then go to a bank and get a line of credit with a lower interest rate.Brooks says he made interest-only payments of around $1,700 via pre-authorized debit each month for two years without incident and claims Morex didn't contact him until June 2021 — two years after the initial agreement — to renew the mortgage.He signed a mortgage renewal agreement that month, which included $16,000 in renewal fees for 2020 and 2021 to be paid upfront. When Brooks couldn't pay that much all at once, he says the company allegedly stopped accepting his monthly payments in July 2021 and has refused to cash cheques he subsequently provided.Morex Capital initiated power-of-sale proceedings in January, seeking to take control of the home and kick Brooks out, according to a statement of claim filed in a Newmarket court.Morex alleges in the claim that Brooks is in default and he owes $248,950.44 — an amount that includes the mortgage principal, interest, missed payments, late fees, legal costs and a host of other fees. That's on top of the $40,800 Brooks already paid in interest.After CBC News reached out to Morex Capital, the company's lawyer disputed Brook's claims as inaccurate, but wouldn't elaborate when asked for specifics. In a subsequent statement, the lawyer said Morex would no longer be pursuing power of sale.""Regardless of the merits of the case in favour of Morex, Morex is committed to working with Mr. Brooks (and with any of its borrowers) to avoid Power of Sale proceedings and will do what they can to assist borrowers to keep their homes,"" Darryl Singer of Diamond & Diamond wrote.'Not a normal mortgage'Toronto real estate lawyers Audrey Loeb and Jonathan Miller of the firm Shibley Righton LLP have taken on Brooks's case on a pro bono basis. They say some of the mortgage's terms, how the deal came together and Brooks's interactions with Morex raise a number of questions.""This is not a normal mortgage,"" said Loeb. ""This is a mortgage used in very unusual circumstances where somebody, I believe, is being taken advantage of.""First of all, Brooks claims Morex referred him to a lawyer to provide him with independent legal representation when signing the mortgage.""When you get … independent legal advice, which is what [Brooks] needed to have as a borrower, he should have gone to a lawyer who had no connection whatsoever to Morex,"" said Loeb. ""And if you're getting referrals from Morex, my view is you have a connection.""Second, the disclosure-to-borrower form Brooks signed in early June 2019 shows the mortgage principal was originally $185,000. Brooks says it was increased to $195,000 when he went to sign the commitment at the lawyer's office on June 27, without explanation.Jonathan Miller and Audrey Loeb are partners at the Toronto real estate law firm Shibley RIghton LLP, and say the terms of Brooks's mortgage raise a number of questions. (Greg Bruce/CBC)Third, Brooks's lawyers say Morex Capital hasn't explained why the person who received $29,000 from the mortgage proceeds was entitled to that payment.Finally, Brooks's lawyers argue many of the fees Morex says Brooks owes seem excessive, including the $8,000 annual renewal fee and legal fees.""In the statement of claim, there's reference to $7,000 in legal fees and and then an additional charge of $7,500, which basically amounts to a fee for being required to tell their lawyer that their borrower is in default,"" said Miller.""All in all, there's probably thirty or forty thousand dollars in amounts that have accrued here that are, in our view, inappropriate.""Brooks and his lawyers say they are not reneging on the mortgage principal or interest, but are seeking to reduce the amount of fees owing to something more manageable, while avoiding a forced sale of the home.""I want to pay Morex off to get them off my back,"" said Brooks. ""When people pay you money, you pay them back. But let's do it in a civil way where no one gets hurt.""Alternative lending a growing industryMore Canadians have been shunning banks and credit unions and seeking mortgages from alternative lenders in recent years. At the same time, investors have poured into the industry, hoping to cash in on a real estate market where property values have skyrocketed.According to Statistics Canada, the value of non-bank mortgages increased more than 10 times between 2007 and 2018 — growing to $86.7 billion in 2018 from $8.5 billion in 2007.Most of that growth has come from mortgage finance corporations (MFCs), which are financial institutions that typically underwrite and sell insured mortgages to the Big Six banks.MFCs are subject to many of the same regulations as banks, which impose strict rules about who they can lend to based on income and credit rating.But mortgage investment corporations (MICs) like Morex Capital, which pool money from private investors to finance customized mortgages, don't have the same lending constraints. They tend to offer shorter term, interest-only loans at higher rates because they are taking on more risk by lending to riskier clients.MICs have also seen double-digit growth annually on average for the past 10 years.Statistics Canada says the total financial assets of MICs reached $32.3 billion in 2020, up from $11.4 billion in 2008.On its website, Morex Capital boasts that investors have received a 9.35 per cent annualized return on their investments since the company's inception in 2012.Ron Butler is a mortgage broker and one of the founders of Butler Mortgage. He says, in general, alternative mortgage lenders are required to ensure that the products they offer to customers are suitable to their financial situation. (CBC News)Ron Butler, a mortgage broker at Butler Mortgage and a 27-year veteran of the industry, says, in general, alternative lenders are obliged to offer a product that is suitable to clients seeking a mortgage.""You must know your client, you must understand their situation, you must understand their relative situation in the future, and you must plan a solution that is suitable to that client,"" said Butler.Borrowers also have a responsibility to know what kind of mortgage they're signing, says Butler.""They should shop around, they should call multiple people, multiple mortgage brokers … and get their own lawyer ahead of time who can give them some advice about what to do and what to look out for,"" said Butler. ""The real problem that exists today is the public has virtually no awareness of how private mortgages work.""";"Mortgage carried 10.49% interest rateAn acquaintance referred him to Morex Capital, a company that invests in ""high yielding, short-term first and second residential Ontario mortgages,"" according to its website.(Greg Bruce/CBC)Third, Brooks's lawyers say Morex Capital hasn't explained why the person who received $29,000 from the mortgage proceeds was entitled to that payment.Alternative lending a growing industryMore Canadians have been shunning banks and credit unions and seeking mortgages from alternative lenders in recent years.But mortgage investment corporations (MICs) like Morex Capital, which pool money from private investors to finance customized mortgages, don't have the same lending constraints.On its website, Morex Capital boasts that investors have received a 9.35 per cent annualized return on their investments since the company's inception in 2012.";['lawyers', 'morex', 'private', 'mortgage', 'gone', 'careful', 'wrong', 'capital', 'fees', 'lawyer', 'seeking', 'pay', 'ontario', 'fighting', 'sign', 'man', 'mortgages', 'brooks'];0.10403061224489794;positive
CBC;Small landlords who became homeless during pandemic blame 'broken' system;"Some landlords in Ontario are becoming homeless — a situation legal experts say they've never seen happen before the COVID-19 pandemic. They blame a ""broken"" tribunal system with significant delays to obtain eviction orders.Franchesca Ranger, a small business owner in Ottawa, found herself homeless during the pandemic after selling her marital home due to a divorce. She decided to move into her rental unit, a townhouse in Barrhaven, and gave her tenant a 75-day termination notice with a move-out date of Aug. 31, 2020.She said her tenant of four years refused to leave, stopped paying rent, and she was left to pay thousands a month in mortgage, property taxes, bills, and storage for her belongings — all while running a small restaurant that was hit hard by lockdowns and pandemic restrictions.""All I could think about was everything I've worked for, and everything I've saved for, my future just being torn away,"" said Ranger, who was ""living out of a suitcase"" from September 2020 until this year.""I felt so let down and so violated.""She was finally able to move back into her home this February, after alternating stays with friends and family every few days.""My life wasn't my own,"" she said.Ranger was finally able to move back into her home this February, after alternating stays with friends and family every few days. (Francis Ferland/CBC)Small landlords — those who typically own just one or two rental units — can become homeless when a tenant refuses to leave a space the landlord needs for their own accommodations.CBC spoke to two other landlords in Ontario who were homeless, or are at risk of homelessness, due to delays in getting a hearing and eviction order from Ontario's Landlord Tenant Board (LTB) — the body that makes decisions when disputes arise between landlords and tenants.Experts and organizations who work with landlords said they've seen dozens become homeless during the pandemic, often accessing homeless shelters, living in vehicles, couch-surfing and even forfeiting their properties to banks due to bankruptcy — all as they wait for the LTB to hear their case and make a final decision.During the pandemic, the province paused evictions and hearings for months at a time, leaving some landlords with nowhere else to go until they're legally able to evict their tenant.""We're trying to navigate our clients through a system that has become so broken,"" said paralegal Kathleen Lovett.WATCH | A landlord describes how she became homeless: How this homeowner became homeless when a tenant refused to move out for 18 months Duration 1:43 Franchesca Ranger found herself homeless when she was unable to move into a townhouse she owned after her primary residence was sold during a divorce. She says the tenants refused to leave — and the process to evict them took 18 months. 1:43The entire process from filing an application to getting a decision should take one to three months, according to LTB's own service standards from before the pandemic.After serving her tenant the N12 notice — a form required under Ontario's Residential and Tenancies Act if a landlord, an immediate family member, or a purchaser intends to move into a rental unit — Ranger had to wait eight months for a hearing.Three days before the hearing, the tenant asked for the hearing to be conducted in French, so she had to wait four more months for a second hearing. It took three months after that for an eviction decision, and about another three for the sheriff's office to come and enforce the eviction.""I find it inconceivable that tax dollars pay for a government body that has zero accountability, that thinks it's OK for someone to own a home and be homeless,"" said Ranger. She wrote letters to several MPPs, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the attorney general, with no response offering help.""How is it possible that someone can rent a place, stop paying rent, and live in it for 18 months? … It doesn't make sense.""Ranger says her former tenant left her home with garbage and debris scattered around. She says they even left a stack of canned goods in one of the washrooms, and a tub full of peanut butter jars. The tenant did not respond to CBC's request to comment on this. (Submitted by Franchesca Ranger)Ranger's former tenant still owes her more than $24,000 in rent arrears and compensation, according to the LTB.That tenant did not respond to CBC's request for an interview or comment. However, in the eviction document, he testified he refused to pay rent since June 2020 because ""he took the N12 to mean he no longer was required to pay.""The tenant stated his wife was disabled and on ODSP and she'd have medical difficulties if evicted because her medical professionals ""were all in the vicinity of the rental unit."" He said the family would be homeless if evicted and he requested Ranger pay him to leave sooner and find another rental unit.Ranger said the tenant left her place in shambles, with jars of peanut butter piled in her bathtub and garbage strewn across her home and lawn.""My house was literally held for ransom,"" said Ranger. ""I guarantee you I will never rent again.""This is what Ranger's backyard looks like after her former tenant of several years was evicted. (Francis Ferland/CBC)""During the wait time, the landlord is going crazy,"" said Boubacar Bah, chair of Small Ownership Landlords of Ontario (SOLO), a non-profit that provides resources and advocates for working-class landlords.Bah said he knows at least 50 landlords involved in his group who became homeless.

CBC;Hampton tenants pushed out of homes for Airbnb after landlord thwarted by rent cap;"Two families living in a duplex in Hampton now have fewer than 30 days to get out, according to eviction notices stuck in their doors on March 31.The previous day, they told their property manager they would not agree to rent increases that would take their rent from $700 per month to $900 for one unit and $1,000 for the other, starting Aug. 1.Those increases would be well over the 3.8 per cent rent cap announced by the New Brunswick government on budget day on March 22.Bill 96, an Act to Amend the Residential Tenancies Act, was tabled March 29 and is widely expected to be passed into law. When that happens, it will apply retroactively from Jan. 1 and be effective through December 2022.Jennifer Taylor thought that meant she could safely refuse to pay an increase of nearly 30 per cent.Instead, she got an eviction notice, informing her that her Hampton apartment is being converted into an Airbnb effective May 1.""Now we have to start packing and looking for a place this affordable,"" said Taylor, who lives with her two teenage children.Michelle Cheslock, who lives on the other side of the duplex, told a similar story. After saying no to a rent change from $700 to $1,000, she's getting evicted, too.New ownersThe building at 27-29 Acadia Cres. changed hands in December.According to Service New Brunswick records, the purchasers are Kevin Hagerman and Isobelle Reid Marianne of Huntsville, Ont. They paid $325,000 for the property, which is assessed at $179,500.Taylor said she got her first notice of a rent increase almost right away, seeking an increase to $1,000 per month effective April 1.Then the province amended the Residential Tenancies Act, requiring landlords to give six months' notice for an increase.Then, last month, the province promised further rent control, with the 3.8 per cent cap.Taylor said the property manager tried to persuade her to ignore that cap and voluntarily pay more.She said she got a phone call on March 30 from Karen Sharp, president of Leading Edge Property Solutions.""She calls and says, 'I'm sure that you've heard about the rent cap in the province. That will only allow us to increase rent by $25, but that is not going to work for the owner,'"" said Taylor.""So then she asks if I would be willing to pay $900 a month starting in August? I said, 'No.'""The very next day, an eviction notice was wedged into her door.Service New Brunswick records indicate 27-29 Acadia Cres. in Hampton, assessed at $179,500, sold for $325,000 in December to an Ontario purchaser. (SNB Property Assessment)Sharp did not provide an interview. Instead, she referred CBC News to her business manager, Alex Urosevic, who said he had permission from Hagerman to speak about the situation.Urosevic described Hagerman as an honourable man who was caught by surprise by a government decision that suddenly made his Hampton investment unsustainable.""If this gentleman had bought his property after the law had passed, I would say, 'Well, you're on your own,'"" said Urosevic. But that was not the case, he said, and with the cap, his client's numbers suddenly didn't work.That's why he decided to ""change his business model,"" said Urosevic.""What he's going to do is turn all the units into short-term rental units. These will be short-term units that people can rent whether they're on vacation or in town for business. There will be no limit on whether they can stay for a week or a month or three months or if somebody needs to stay longer.""The duplex at 27-29 Acadia Cres. in Hampton is in a residential zone, according to Arthur McCarthy, the town’s building and development officer. Accommodations, such as short-term lodging for travellers, require commercial zoning. (Submitted/Jennifer Taylor)Taylor said she still believes there's something that can stop this.She thinks it might come down to zoning.Airbnbs are not explicitly listed in Hampton's bylaw definitions.Currently, 27-29 Acadia Cres. is zoned residential, according to the town's building and development officer Arthur McCarthy.Accommodations, which are defined as hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts and other lodging for travellers, are only allowed in Hampton's commercial zones.McCarthy said the owner could apply to council for a zoning amendment, which could take three to six months.'Everybody's doing it'Urosevic said the province was wrong to blindside purchasers with a rent cap that had been rejected before.In May, a review of the province's rental housing market ruled out caps on rent increases in all but the most extreme cases.He said he knows purchasers who are backing out of deals because of the surprise.He also knows of buyers who are acquiring property anyway, with ""full intentions to evict the entire building and do so-called reno-victions.""""Everybody is doing that,"" he said. ""I can tell you about 20 properties that are doing that because their hands are tied behind their backs [by this cap].""Urosevic said Hagerman does intend to make significant upgrades to his property that could surpass $100,000. That includes spending $35,000 on a third unit to make it livable again. Urosevic said it was left in pretty rough shape.He said three-bedroom units with a private yard, private parking and laundry facilities in that part of Hampton should be fetching $1,200 on the market.Landlords can end tenancies for Airbnbs with proper noticeCheslock and Taylor said this wasn't the rent when they moved in and they were expecting the promised protection to apply.Both have contacted the rentalsman seeking advice but as of Friday, Cheslock hadn't heard back at all, and Taylor was waiting for answers.CBC asked to speak to the province's chief residential tenancies officer, Jessica Bernier, but she was unavailable.In an email to CBC, a department spokesperson wrote that Airbnbs don't fall under the Residential Tenancy Tribunal Act because they're not rented or leased as residences.""Under the provisions of the act, landlords can end tenancies if they intend to convert the property to an Airbnb, provided proper notice is given to tenants,"" the spokesperson wrote.""For month-to-month leases, the landlord must provide one month's written notice, and for year-to-year leases, the landlord must provide three months' written notice.""";"Those increases would be well over the 3.8 per cent rent cap announced by the New Brunswick government on budget day on March 22.Bill 96, an Act to Amend the Residential Tenancies Act, was tabled March 29 and is widely expected to be passed into law.""She calls and says, 'I'm sure that you've heard about the rent cap in the province.'Everybody's doing it'Urosevic said the province was wrong to blindside purchasers with a rent cap that had been rejected before.CBC asked to speak to the province's chief residential tenancies officer, Jessica Bernier, but she was unavailable.";['cap', 'hampton', 'landlord', 'notice', 'act', 'units', 'tenants', 'rent', 'thwarted', 'airbnb', 'property', 'residential', 'homes', 'tenancies', 'month', 'pushed'];0.08245165945165947;neutral
CBC;Ontario lakeside towns push to regulate short-term rentals to preserve their way of life;"There's a growing movement among Ontario lakeside communities to push back against short-term rental services, such as Airbnb and VRBO, that some say are disrupting the social fabric of their close-knit rural communities to the point where it could upend their way of life.The Municipality of Lambton Shores is the latest to look at more stringent regulations for the beach communities of Port Franks, Ipperwash and Grand Bend, when council reviewed a draft bylaw on Tuesday to license short-term rentals, put a cap on occupancy at 10 people per dwelling and create a 24/7 hotline for locals to report nuisance parties.Port Stanley, a beach town on Lake Erie's shore that's part of Central Elgin municipality, is also considering a bylaw and recently voted 4-3 to study the issue to hopefully have a licensing scheme in place next year.""To me we needed to regulate it,"" said Mayor Sally Martyn, noting most homes sold in town often get scooped up by out-of-town investors looking to turn them into short-term rentals. ""It's a real problem in Port Stanley.""Preventive medicineOthers, such as the Town of Goderich, are weighing their options. ""Canada's prettiest town"" only has about 30 short-term rentals, but as they grow in number, it's becoming clear to some that they can influence more than just property prices.While it may have all-year industry, such as the town's salt mine as shown here, with a slogan like 'Canada's prettiest town,' Goderich gets plenty of tourists. So council is looking at regulating short-term rentals before they become a problem. (Colin Butler/CBC)""We have to be careful that we don't erode that rural fabric and rural neighbourhoods that we've had for centuries,"" said Goderich Mayor John Grace.With factories, a courthouse and the largest salt mine on Earth, Goderich is far more than just a tourist town.Goderich's 7,600 residents live there year round and they worry that if enough of the community's homes get bought up by absentee landlords who operate short-term rentals, it would alter the centuries-long tradition of neighbours helping neighbours that keeps the community bonded together.We need to make sure it doesn't take over our neighbourhoods. - Goderich Mayor John Grace""We need to get a handle on it, we need to manage it and we need to make sure it doesn't take over our neighbourhoods.""The Municipality of South Bruce Peninsula, a collection of beach towns about an hour and a half northeast on the coast of Georgian Bay learned that lesson the hard way.'Every cottage country town is facing this'The community — which includes the lakeside towns of Red Bay, Mallory Beach and Sauble — cracked down on short-term rentals in January 2021, creating a licensing scheme, a round-the-clock hotline to report party houses, and a ""three strikes and you're out"" system to keep absentee landlords in line with neighbours' expectations.A little girl plays on a beach in Sauble Beach, Ont., where municipal officials estimate up to 15 per cent of private dwellings are short-term rentals. (Colin Butler/CBC News)If they don't, they're liable to lose their licence and could face fines of up to $500 a day, according to Mayor Janice Jackson, who said the tradition of cottaging in the community took on new intensity with the financialization of housing in Ontario.""We're not messing around. Partiers and people who don't care about our community are not welcome here.""We're fielding increasing complaints from the community where their neighbour sold their place and now it's party house next door, and it's just been heartbreaking to hear some of the stories.""We're getting people who are buying houses sight unseen.""Jackson said it's estimated short-term rentals now account for up to 15 per cent of all private dwellings in her community, which has had serious impact on the community, turning otherwise residential neighbourhoods into tourist zones.""Every cottage country town is facing this and COVID has really exacerbated this issue. So we had to do something.""If this continues, we're going to get to a point, maybe five years from now, where we have equal amount of rental properties to our permanent residents,"" Jackson said.""That is going to erode the fabric of the community, there's no question.""Jackson said the pandemic and the rise of the staycation brought so many visitors and outside investors to town that something had to be done to balance things out.""We want people to come up here and enjoy South Bruce Peninsula because it's absolutely gorgeous here, but you've got to respect your neighbours.

CBC;Please stop asking me where I got COVID;"This First Person column is written by Melinda Maldonado who is recovering from long COVID. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see the FAQ.When my dog looked at me with pleading eyes and a whine, I reluctantly grabbed her leash and made it downstairs. I knew I was too exhausted to walk Estelle long enough to tire her out but a grassy fenced area in my condo complex caught my eye on that cold February day. I looked at my dog and we agreed: to hell with it.Soon it was my dog leaping into the air and me expending zero energy in one spot in an endless loop of fetch. It was glorious until a neighbour hollered at me to get out.That's when I started oversharing with strangers: ""I had COVID and I'm really struggling with fatigue right now.""My neighbour was more interested in bylaw enforcement than sympathy, but that didn't deter me from giving it a go with others. Since then, I've had a lot of practice because three months after a breakthrough COVID infection that left me bedridden for weeks, I'm still managing debilitating fatigue.Today, everyone knows someone who has been ""omicroned"" but there is still so much stigma associated with it. Contact tracing is no longer being done, but when I got COVID, everyone wanted to know how I got it.Before blurting things out to neighbours, I self-flagellated my way through a self-audit of where I'd been. Since December, my husband and I hunkered down after a public health call spooked us with news of a possible exposure. We isolated as much as condo-dwellers can with a dog, which means frequent elevator rides.My audit results: no moral slip-ups. Shame is so 2020. I texted friends a photo of the two lines I'd achieved on a rapid antigen test: ""FML.""Melinda Maldonado holds up the rapid test showing she tested positive for COVID-19. (Melinda Maldonado)But the proof that stigma is alive is in how we talk about it. My social feeds have been full of COVID stories and most include one detail: vaccination status. It's OK to announce you had it if you're fully vaccinated. It's OK to post photos of in-person gatherings if you confirm that everyone did rapid tests. Flouting public health guidelines? Not me.I get it. Mentioning that I'm triple-vaccinated in the same breath as revealing I had COVID feels important. Obviously, go get vaccinated as vaccines can help reduce the risk of getting long COVID .But I'm telling you that getting COVID wasn't my personal failure to prevent it. I didn't throw caution to the wind, cavorting with the unmasked at raucous parties.Stigma crops up in the way people rationalize away potential cases of COVID, which have been harder to confirm since Ontario changed the rules about who qualifies for a PCR test. Cough and runny nose? Allergies, a sinus infection or as one cousin said, ""I still maintain it was a winter cold!""But that stigma has also changed my mindset to be more vocal about my needs.A few weeks ago, I had a bad day. Physical, mental or emotional exertion drains energy , and I had spent my day's rations on cognitive load at work. I was trying to stand up from sitting on the floor when my arms gave out. I looked at my husband and burst into tears. ""It's like being in prison,"" he said. ""Eventually you'll get out.""Since then I've hired a dog walker and gone on sick leave, with plans to gradually return to work when I'm ready.Melinda Maldonado, who suffers from long COVID, recovers her strength in bed beside her dog, Estelle. (Melinda Maldonado)But that's not the only thing that's changed. The pandemic had already made me more assertive, sparking conversations about boundaries that before I'd reserved for the world of safe sex.""Do you do hugs? Where are you at with gatherings? Are you comfortable with dining indoors?""And somewhere over the last two years that ramped up something fierce. I went from quietly seething to the woman who would firmly tell a neighbour to stay the hell out of the elevator if they weren't wearing a mask.Today, I speak up to shatter the stigma of being marked by long COVID.In a society that rewards ambition, people with long COVID can face stigma from family, friends or colleagues who think you're just being lazy, have undiagnosed depression or simply need a vacation.Anticipating judgement, the new me acts like a crisis communications pro and gets out in front of the bad news. So I tell people that I have long COVID, and I'm increasingly opening up about how awful it feels to be in the middle of an unexpected, unknown experience, or the real reason I might need to peace out at short notice to rest.The pressure ramps up for me because I'm normally a boisterous person with big energy. Even while suffering today, I look healthy. ""A muted you still appears more energetic than most people on a good day,"" a colleague said.But fatigue is an invisible ailment.Like Cinderella, the clock starts ticking on the time I have for any given activity. I can hold my own for one work-from-home meeting at a time, but no one sees that I'm resting before and after to pace myself , or the crash that comes upon overexertion.Recently, I felt well enough to eat out for my dad's birthday. As main course plates cleared and coffees arrived, I announced that Cinderella's clock was ticking. When I took my leave, I knew I'd done a good day's work of shattering stigma, but more importantly that I wasn't alone.Do you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others? We want to hear from you. Here's more info on how to pitch to us.";"This First Person column is written by Melinda Maldonado who is recovering from long COVID.That's when I started oversharing with strangers: ""I had COVID and I'm really struggling with fatigue right now.""Obviously, go get vaccinated as vaccines can help reduce the risk of getting long COVID .Melinda Maldonado, who suffers from long COVID, recovers her strength in bed beside her dog, Estelle.Today, I speak up to shatter the stigma of being marked by long COVID.";['id', 'work', 'rapid', 'covid', 'test', 'stigma', 'person', 'im', 'long', 'asking', 'dog', 'stop'];0.06595221509014614;neutral
CBC;Fixer says former Alberta justice minister hired him to get reporter's phone logs;"A self-described political fixer says a former Alberta justice minister hired him to obtain a reporter's phone logs.David Wallace says he was hired by Jonathan Denis to get the phone records of Alanna Smith, a former Calgary Herald reporter now of The Canadian Press. Wallace said Denis told him he wanted to trace sources Smith had drawn on for a story about whether the size of Denis's wedding reception broke COVID-19 protocols.In an email from his lawyer, Denis denied that he or his clients talked to Wallace.Wallace told The Canadian Press that Denis got his name through Alan Hallman and Gerald Chipeur, longtime conservative operatives.""Jonathan called me (and) told me that at his wedding he feels he had been targeted for poor press,"" Wallace said in an interview. ""He wanted to find out who (Smith's) sources were.""He wanted me to go into my source contacts using databases to their private cellphone information communications.""Wallace said he warned Denis that obtaining phone logs could be illegal.""He basically said this is just information I'm gathering for my own use.""Denis was a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister in Alberta from 2010 to 2015 and justice minister for the last three of those years. Recently, he has been reported to be an organizer for Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre's campaign for leadership of the federal party.Wallace said he gets politicians out of tight spots for a living.According to the political fixer, David Wallace, Jonathan Denis obtained his name through Alan Hallman, pictured, and Gerald Chipeur, both longtime conservative operatives. (CBC)""I'm a repairman,"" said Wallace, a former Ontarian now living in Calgary. ""I can find things or people and I can massage and fix difficult situations.""Wallace said he has had a 30-year career in political backrooms. He spoke with The Canadian Press because, he said, he's had enough.""I'm tired of being a tool,"" he said. ""I'm done.""Wallace said he's also grown concerned his work could be used to intimidate people or improperly influence political debate.Wallace, who is not a licensed private investigator, said he was lured to the West by the promise of lucrative contracts from people prominent in Alberta conservative circles. In early 2021, he said,he heard from Hallman.Hallman, whose association with provincial Conservative politics goes back to the 1990s, managed Jason Kenney's 2017 campaign for the leadership of the United Conservative Party until he was suspended for one year. At the time, Hallman said the suspension was related to the use of profanity in a social media post.He remains close to the premier. In 2020, he held a birthday party for Kenney attended by two cabinet ministers, said a guest who was there. His son, Chad Hallman, works as a political staffer for Alberta Health.""I got a phone call from Hallman, asking me to speak to his friend Jonathan,"" Wallace said. ""I said, 'OK.""'Dozens of emails, text messages, bank statementsWallace backs up what he says with dozens of emails, text messages, bank statements, invoices and other electronic documents. They include messages that appear to be from Denis, but Denis has not confirmed they are his.The Canadian Press has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the emails and other documents using the data accompanying them.However, some emails involve people not involved in this story. The Canadian Press contacted seven. Five confirmed they had sent the emails and two declined comment  none said the emails were false or altered.In the documents, a message that appears to come from Denis claims the Calgary Herald received a tip about his Jan. 30, 2021, wedding reception.He appears to say the tip was an attempt to embarrass UCP legislature member Mike Ellis, a guest at the reception and party whip. Ellis was then thought to be considering a run for Calgary mayor.The documents suggest Denis was trying to find the source of the tip through Smith's phone logs.""She and the Herald are not the target,"" said a Feb. 13, 2021, purported email from Denis to Wallace. ""I want to find out who's pushing this.""A separate email the same day suggests Wallace and Denis reached a deal. Denis would pay Wallace $5,000 per month based on at least 20 hours per week.""How long do you anticipate working on this before likely achieving results?"" asks an email sent the next day, seemingly from Denis.""Rest easy, it won't be a hard fix,"" Wallace appears to have responded. ""People like the ones who do such things are always sloppy and leave lots of evidence.""The emails suggest Denis hired Wallace on Feb. 15.""I am hiring you on the recommendation of Alan Hallman, who says you have got tangible results for him,"" said an email that day, apparently from Denis to Wallace.""Respectfully, I expect the same, and can send you a fair bit of more work if this investigation bears fruit. I should let you know that one of your competitors in Calgary told me there was no way he could get results here, so my chips are on you.""A Feb. 15 e-transfer receipt appears to show a payment of $5,350 from Denis to Wallace. An email sent two days later appears to show Denis promising Wallace more work ""if we can meet with some success here.""The documents provided by Wallace say the work didn't take long. By March 20, a message purportedly from Wallace reported results.""Hello, picking up the cell carrier logs from my source this afternoon,"" says an email from an account that appears to belong to Wallace. ""I'll need $1,100 to cover the rest of bill for it. If that's authorized let me know and you can e-transfer me.""The documents seem to show an $1,180 payment from Denis to Wallace was made the following week.Wallace said he falsified some of the information he gave Denis out of concern for the reporter's safety.""The records are legitimate,"" he said. ""I just didn't provide him with the legitimate phone box in terms of the actual calls, times and orders.""The emails seem to suggest Denis was initially satisfied. On April 11, one says: ""May have a new file for you (Wallace). Chat me up in the a.m.""Tone changesBut by June, a new tone creeps in.""I've been requesting backup documents in my matter now for over two months,"" says a June 23 email, purportedly from Denis.""I've paid you 'good money' for this report but it is useless to me without the backup documents. I have a lot more work I can throw you in Calgary from me personally and from my contacts. However — I need this documentation.""Denis's lawyer, Brendan Miller, said in a letter his client is unable to respond to questions raised by the emails because that would force Denis to violate solicitor-client privilege.""As Mr. Denis is committed to upholding his professional obligations, we are unable to respond,"" wrote Miller.""If there were information conveyed between Mr. Denis or his clients with Mr. Wallace (which is not admitted but denied), it would be subject to privilege.""Miller does not specify which client he is referring to. Ellis's press secretary, Eric Engler, said Ellis has not hired Denis for over a decade and was not aware of or in any way involved in efforts to obtain the reporter's phone logs.Hallman seemed to have maintained interest in Wallace's work. In an apparent March 28, 2021, WhatsApp message to Wallace, he asked if any phone numbers from previous messages ""line up with the Jonathan investigation.""The documents include a seeming non-disclosure agreement blocking Wallace from releasing communications between him and Hallman. Signed in April, it also forbids Wallace from making disparaging comments about Hallman and releases Hallman from any liability toward Wallace.In a brief telephone conversation, Hallman refused to comment on Wallace's claims, but acknowledged knowing him.""The guy's unstable,"" Hallman told The Canadian Press. ""I want nothing to do with him.""Hallman did not respond to a registered letter delivered to his office March 25 containing a list of detailed questions.Wallace's emails suggest Hallman wasn't the only conservative operative familiar with Wallace.A Jan. 17, 2021, note that appears to be from Chipeur reads: ""The client is very happy with your previous assistance,"" then goes on to offer Wallace a contract.Chipeur was a lawyer for the federal Conservative party and helped work out the merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform Party of Canada.He did not respond to a letter delivered to his office April 1.These days, Wallace said, he isn't interested in new contracts.

CBC;Inside the alleged fraud and forgery at Quebec's Lester B. Pearson School Board;"A few months after the Lester B. Pearson School Board fired the head of its international department in 2016, Quebec's anti-corruption unit was called in to investigate suspected wrongdoing.Dubbed ""Project Pandore,"" the investigation focused on allegations of fraud, forged documents and abuse of power at the department as it rapidly expanded.Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, the department grew from seven students to 777, bringing in millions of dollars in tuition fees for the Montreal-area English-language school board.Court documents obtained by CBC News shed light on the investigation that ultimately led to the arrest of Caroline Mastantuono, the former head of the department, her daughter Christina Mastantunono, who also worked in the department, and Naveen Kolan, a Toronto-based consultant with Edu Edge Inc. (EEI).The school board and Edu Edge had an agreement in place at the time aimed at attracting adult foreign students for vocational school.The three individuals were charged in November 2020 , but details of the allegations against them — and their alleged impact on the English-language school board serving 20,000 students in the Montreal area — have been scarce until now.All three face charges involving fraud against the school board and the province's Immigration Ministry, as well as the fabrication and use of forged documents, for acts allegedly committed between 2014 and 2016.The trial is set for January 2023.The court documents contain what's known as a ""trial brief,"" which outlines the prosecution's case. The list of potential witnesses includes a forensic accountant, a signature specialist, former and current school board staff and several dozen students.The allegations have not been proven in court, and all three accused have pleaded not guilty.In a statement on behalf of his client Christina Mastantuono and the other two accused, lawyer Jonathan Gordon declined to comment on specifics, but he said the trial brief ""contains unproven allegations to which our clients have not had the opportunity to respond in the course of the judicial proceedings.""Forged documentsAccording to the trial brief, in the spring of 2014, Christina Mastantuono told her mother the province's Immigration Ministry wouldn't grant some international students the Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ), a mandatory immigration document, because the students did not have the necessary funds to cover their tuition.The prosecution explains how Caroline Mastantuono, along with Kolan, told staff at the school board they would create fake tuition receipts for Indian students to make it appear they had paid in full.The forged documents, described as ""false receipts,"" allegedly allowed the students to obtain their CAQs. They also enabled Kolan's firm, EEI, to bill the school board a recruitment commission.Naveen Kolan of Edu Edge Inc., right, is seen here signing an agreement with Lester B. Pearson School Board former chair Suanne Stein Day and former director general Robert Mills in 2012. (Edu Edge Inc./Facebook)Christina Mastantuono, along with two other staff members, were at one point responsible for the forged documents, the trial brief alleges.Later on, it's alleged, only Christina signed the documents, because ""Caroline Mastantuono did not want employees blamed for these acts.""In all, the prosecution alleges there were 81 forged receipts of payment, with the overall potential loss to the school board estimated at $1.5 million.Embezzlement schemeA second scheme alleged by the prosecution involves the embezzlement of funds destined for the Lester B. Pearson board.The school board kept records of which international students applied to its programs through a recruiting agency and which ones applied on their own.It did not have to pay a commission for students who applied on their own.According to the trial brief, two staff members in the international department discovered students without an agent had been assigned to a B.C.-based numbered company registered in the name of Naveen Kolan's wife, Suneetha Yanala.Christina Mastantuono allegedly told staff this was done to ""compensate Naveen Kolan for the money supposedly owed to him"" by the school board.However, there were no signed agreements between the board and the B.C. recruiting company.Caroline Mastantuono, left, and her daughter Christina Mastantuono, seen here in 2016, both worked at the Lester B. Pearson School Board. They were charged in 2020 for fraud in relation to their work in the international department. (CBC)Caroline Mastantuono signed on the school board's behalf, and Kolan signed on behalf of the B.C. company, according to the trial brief.These contracts were ""untraceable"" by the school board, the documents said.A forensic analysis shows four cheques from the school board totalling $119,000 were sent to the numbered company.School board files lawsuitOfficials for the Lester B. Pearson School Board declined to comment on what is contained in the trial brief, saying the matter is now before the courts.The school board sued Edu Edge in 2016 in an attempt to recoup lost earnings. In response, the firm countered that it was actually the one owed $5.5 million.In 2019, the accounting firm Ernst & Young was appointed to help make sense of the financial dispute, but the case has still not been resolved.Danielle McCann, Quebec's minister of higher education, has promised to tighten regulations around private colleges in the province. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)The same summer that the accounting firm was appointed, Quebec's Ministry of Higher Education granted the Mastantuonos a licence to operate M College, a private institution catering to international students, even though the criminal investigation was underway, and a provincial audit had found a litany of ""irregularities"" with the school board's international department.The Mastantuonos went on to acquire CDE and CCSQ colleges in the spring of 2020, just months before Caroline and Christina were charged with fraud for alleged financial irregularities when they worked at the Pearson Board.The three colleges filed for creditor protection earlier this year.The colleges have blamed their financial troubles on the COVID-19 pandemic, ill-timed expansion and changes to the immigration process for international students, which led to long visa delays.They were sold last month, which could allow many students to resume their studies, but hundreds of others are still seeking refunds.";A few months after the Lester B.

CBC;Here's why thousands of Etsy sellers are boycotting the platform;"When Tricia Robinson first got on Etsy in 2013, it was to help save her cat's life.""My cat got really ill and I was getting vet bills through the roof and I couldn't afford to pay them,"" Robinson said. ""So I created an illustration that was inspired by him and I sold it.""That's when Robinson realized she could use the platform to sell more of her work and actually make a living off of it.But after receiving her first payment from Etsy, the Montreal artist says she was struck by the difference between her sales and the amount that was being deposited into her account. That's when she paid attention to all the fees Etsy charges sellers on the platform.At first, she was okay with it.Tricia Robinson has been selling her artwork on Etsy for nine years. Now, she's planning to boycotting the website over Etsy's fee increase. (CBC News)""It kind of became this thing of like, okay, well, I'm making money as an artist. I have access to this online marketplace. It's pretty cool for the most part,"" she said.Etsy was founded in 2005, offering an online marketplace for artists and craftspeople to sell handmade and vintage items as well as craft supplies. The website has attracted millions of buyers and sellers and provided a platform for artists to become entrepreneurs.But over the years, Robinson says she started to see her margins shrink as Etsy's grew. A policy introduced in 2019 incentivized sellers to offer free shipping for purchases over $35 US by promising to optimize those shops to U.S. buyers. Robinson first refused to opt in, but eventually caved as she saw her U.S. sales disappear.Offering free shipping was taking off at least half her profit margin, she said. That's when things started to go downhill on the platform for Robinson.""[Etsy] was this really great marketplace that did celebrate handmade and local small business,"" said Robinson. ""But they're not like that anymore.""Now, Robinson is one of thousands of sellers who have said they plan to boycott the site from April 11 to 18 after the site announced it would be hiking its transaction fees from five to 6.5 per cent.Fee hike sparks petitionThis comes after Etsy's strong fourth quarter earnings, which beat expectations.The announcement led Kristi Cassidy, a seamstress from Westerly, Rhode Island, to start a petition after posting on Reddit calling for an Etsy sellers' union. Cassidy told CBC News more than 17,000 sellers joined the boycott as of Monday morning.""The post was basically asking when does this end because it's just getting worse and worse and I don't think it's going to end unless we do something,"" she said.The petition also lists other demands, including letting sellers opt out of off-site advertising, which generates sales that Etsy charges sellers more for.Cassidy says she stopped offering custom orders through Etsy because she could be charged as much as $100 for a dress sale that comes from an off-site ad.In a statement, an Etsy spokesperson said the increase in fee will help boost their investments in marketing, customer support, and removing listings that don't meet company policies.""Our revised fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in each of these key areas so that we can better serve our community,"" the statement reads.Tricia Robinson, an illustrator based in Montreal, used Etsy to sell her artwork. (CBC News)Company faces shareholder pressure to boost profits, says expertEtsy has historically had an open and honest relationship with its sellers, says University of British Columbia professor David Clough.However, Clough says it has become strained over the years.""Since 2018, they've raised their fees twice, which suggests they're trying to perhaps profit at the expense of their marketplace sellers,"" he said.Etsy became a publicly traded company in 2015, making it susceptible to shareholder pressure.With over five million sellers on the site and 90 million customers, Clough says raising transaction fees is a new way for the company to boost its bottom line.""As they've expanded their user base, it becomes harder to grow revenue by adding more users. So this makes them look for other sources of revenue.""Kristi Cassidy designs gothic wedding dresses and costumes that she would sell on Etsy. She started a petition calling on Etsy to cancel its planned fee increase. (Kristi Cassidy)Etsy's fees are still lower than e-commerce competitors like Amazon, which charges eight to 15 per cent in addition to other fees.Still, continuing to raise fees could risk Etsy's reputation as they deviate further from the initial values of the company that allowed small businesses to make money, he says.As for the boycott's potential effect on Etsy, Clough says it could create momentum for more dialogue between the company and sellers as a collective entity.""If they face pushback from sellers for this raise, then it makes them think twice about raising the fees down the line,"" he said.Cassidy says she hasn't been in communication with Etsy about the petition and the boycott.And while she's not counting on Etsy rolling back its fee hike, she says she's excited about building a community of sellers that want to advocate for better pay and company policies.""The things that we could do together, it feels limitless,"" she said.";"That's when she paid attention to all the fees Etsy charges sellers on the platform.Now, she's planning to boycotting the website over Etsy's fee increase.The announcement led Kristi Cassidy, a seamstress from Westerly, Rhode Island, to start a petition after posting on Reddit calling for an Etsy sellers' union.The petition also lists other demands, including letting sellers opt out of off-site advertising, which generates sales that Etsy charges sellers more for.""Since 2018, they've raised their fees twice, which suggests they're trying to perhaps profit at the expense of their marketplace sellers,"" he said.";['thousands', 'etsy', 'fee', 'sellers', 'heres', 'robinson', 'fees', 'boycotting', 'platform', 'sell', 'marketplace', 'petition', 'company', 'increase'];0.13818577936224993;positive
CBC;Money manager for ultra-rich has almost $5M tax bill, but CRA can't get its hands on assets;"He's a self-described money manager for the ultra-rich, with a penchant for pricey champagne and a personal wealth in the eight figures.But Charles Shaker also has a penchant for not paying his taxes, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) claims. And thanks to a lack of transparency — in tax havens but also in Canada — around who owns certain kinds of assets, it's proving hard for the CRA to do anything about it.Shaker, a British-Canadian financial adviser, made tabloid headlines in 2013 when he ordered a $500,000 round of choice bubbly for revellers at a Formula One party in Monaco. The incident was later featured in a CNBC show called The Filthy Rich Guide.A video of the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix party shows a procession of waiters bringing in bottles of brut — the biggest one was 30 litres — held high over their heads, sparklers crackling in hand. (YouTube)What the news stories didn't reveal is that around the same time, auditors in Ottawa were poring over his finances — in large part because his name was on a whistleblower's list of 130,000 people and entities with ties to confidential accounts at HSBC's private bank in Geneva.Shaker already had a relatively modest balance owing of $32,797 at that point, court records show. But after CRA accountants went back over his file, they issued the multimillionaire an updated tax bill for the hefty sum of $3.8 million in 2017.Five years later, Shaker — who moved from the Ottawa area to England in 2009 and took up residency in Monaco around 2015 — hasn't paid, the CRA says in court filings. With interest, his bill now sits at more than $4.8 million.Court files show the CRA wrote to Charles Shaker earlier this year about his huge – and growing – tax bill, saying it could take action to seize his assets. (CBC)He says this is the first he's hearing of it, and he will contest the amount.""The CRA has not been in contact with me since the creation of the alleged reassessments giving rise to the purported tax debt,"" the 42-year-old said in a sworn statement filed in court.""The CRA has repeatedly made mistakes in sending out correspondence over the course of a number of years.""CRA fails to nab penthouse proceedsThe dispute is playing out in Federal Court.In early November, the government filed a motion to force Shaker's sometime lawyer, Chadwick Boyd of Ottawa, to provide information about a luxury downtown Toronto penthouse that had Boyd's, Shaker's and another man's name on the land title.If Shaker actually owned part of the condo, the CRA could go after it to recoup his tax debt.Weeks after the CRA tried, so far unsuccessfully, to get the records from Boyd, the penthouse and another one in downtown Toronto were put on the market. They both sold around New Year's — one went for $2.5 million, the other for $1.8 million — and closed two weeks ago.The online real estate listing for one of the penthouses shows a 2,200-square-foot, four-bedroom unit with floor to ceiling windows and views of Lake Ontario. (bhtours.ca)The CRA once again went to court, this time to get a cut of sale proceeds, arguing that Shaker had an interest in both properties that could be used toward his alleged $4.8 million in tax debts.But the government hit a snag — the penthouses were owned in trust, an arrangement where one or several people have legal ownership of an asset but only for the benefit of third parties. One of the condos was held by Shaker, Boyd and another man for the ""Richie Rich Holdings Trust,"" the other for an entity called the ""Vinyl Spin Investment Trust.""Court records show the CRA had been trying to get Shaker and others to provide information about the trusts, and who the real beneficiaries were, since at least 2015, to no avail. Without that information, the agency couldn't prove Shaker was a beneficiary, and he himself said in a sworn statement he had no ""personal interest whatsoever"" in either property. So a judge refused to allow the CRA to touch the proceeds.""Mr. Shaker is a judgment debtor in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as a trustee of the RRH Trust,"" Federal Court Judge Elizabeth Walker ruled on March 24. ""Trust property is not available to the creditors of a trustee where the debt in question is the trustee's personal debt.""Ironically, she ordered the government to pay Shaker $12,000 for his legal costs.Pandora Papers leak reveals $4M flat in LondonThe federal treasury will now have to look elsewhere for assets it can seize. But that could prove even more difficult than the government's doomed attempt to go after the Toronto condos.Records from a number of leaks of tax-haven financial data, shared with CBC News through its collaboration with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show Shaker at one point owned or was a director of several offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and Barbados.He's in the Pandora Papers leak from last fall, where CBC News found his name on a BVI company called Branstead Ltd.Officially, that company has other people apparently serving as ""nominees,"" or stand-ins who sign their names on paper as the directors and shareholders — as fronts for the real owner, essentially. The sole shareholder, on paper, is another corporation called Monet Investment Ltd., with an address in the Seychelles, according to the files in the Pandora Papers.But one of the leaked documents is a form dated 2017 from an offshore services provider called Trident Trust, declaring Shaker is the ""beneficial,"" or actual, owner of Branstead Ltd. The company's declared activity is ""property holding.""A form dated 2017, found in the Pandora Papers leak (with some details redacted by CBC for privacy), is the only record of Charles Shaker’s ownership of an offshore company called Branstead Ltd. In its official registries, the company has what appear to be front people listed as its directors and shareholder. (CBC)It is legal in most jurisdictions, including Canada, to use nominee directors and shareholders, but it's often a tactic — especially in tax havens — to hide the people who truly control a company and its assets.Branstead Ltd., in turn, owns a penthouse apartment in the Canary Wharf area in London that was purchased in 2010 for the equivalent of $4 million, U.K. property records show.The CRA told CBC News that, in general, it could potentially use terms in Canada's tax treaty with Britain to try to recover a tax debt from someone living in England.Without access to the Pandora Papers leak, though, the CRA would almost certainly not be able to make the link between Shaker and the multimillion-dollar London apartment.That's because Britain, like most of Canada, does not record the identities of the beneficial owners of property — the real owners behind layers of corporations or trusts — in its land registry. And the British Virgin Islands, like most of the world, doesn't require corporations to disclose who their real shareholders are.""[The CRA's] hands are tied because they simply don't have the tools to be following those assets around the world,"" said Kevin Comeau, a lawyer and expert on corporate transparency.Public registries would help CRA, lawyer saysComeau, alongside numerous transparency groups, has been advocating for years for countries and Canada's provinces to adopt beneficial-ownership registries that publicly record who the real owners are of land and of significant shareholdings in private companies.Not only would that help crack down on money-laundering, by potentially exposing where criminals or their known associates park ill-gotten gains, but in the tax arena, it could give revenue agencies like the CRA ""much more information and an ability to trace those funds"" of people who might not be paying their fair share, he said.British Columbia is the only jurisdiction in Canada with a beneficial ownership registry for property, implemented in the wake of findings of significant money-laundering in the province's real estate sector.Meanwhile, the federal government has pledged to implement one for corporations by the end of 2023, as part of the deal between the minority Liberals and the NDP.Shaker 'denies any allegation or implication'The CRA wouldn't comment on its legal spat with financial adviser Shaker, citing strict taxpayer confidentiality rules.But it said that in general, initiatives to promote transparency are ""a positive step"" to help enforce tax laws.""Having access to information on the true owners, beneficiaries, directing minds or related parties of an entity or asset better positions tax administrations around the world to tightening the net on those high net-worth individuals, corporations and entities who try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes,"" the CRA said in a statement.Shaker's British passport and Monaco residency card are among the leaked records in the Pandora Papers (edited by CBC for privacy). (CBC)CBC News sent a list of questions and preliminary research findings to Shaker and his lawyers — among them, the fact that his offshore company Branstead Ltd. appears to make use of nominee directors and shareholders, and that this would tend to frustrate the CRA's ability to collect on any tax debt he owes.They did not answer specific queries, but one of those lawyers replied broadly last week that Shaker ""denies any allegation or implication set out in your list of questions"" and that ""he will continue to legally establish his case in the courts.""Send tips on this or any other story to zach.dubinsky@cbc.ca or call 416-205-7553.";"He's a self-described money manager for the ultra-rich, with a penchant for pricey champagne and a personal wealth in the eight figures.But after CRA accountants went back over his file, they issued the multimillionaire an updated tax bill for the hefty sum of $3.8 million in 2017.Court files show the CRA wrote to Charles Shaker earlier this year about his huge – and growing – tax bill, saying it could take action to seize his assets.If Shaker actually owned part of the condo, the CRA could go after it to recoup his tax debt.""Trust property is not available to the creditors of a trustee where the debt in question is the trustee's personal debt.""";['called', '5m', 'tax', 'manager', 'records', 'bill', 'money', 'assets', 'ultrarich', 'hands', 'property', 'cant', 'papers', 'real', 'trust', 'shaker', 'cra', 'company'];0.07514549097073371;neutral

CBC;Halifax set up mobile showers for a month, but they were never used. A new report examines why;"Halifax regional council's mobile shower pilot project started as a well-intentioned idea to provide hygiene to people who are homeless.A six-stall shower trailer was set up in a field in Dartmouth, ready to use, last November.But in the month it was open, it was never used.A new report written by Jo Parker, the program co-ordinator of Mainline Needle Exchange in Halifax, examines the reasons the project failed and makes recommendations for making such a service more accessible to the population it's meant to serve.Project ended earlyThe project was approved in September 2021, and was meant to run for nine weeks at a cost of $16,999.The shower trailer was open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30.The project was undertaken in conjunction with Mainline Needle Exchange, and the shower was staffed by peers and employees of the organization. Security was provided by a private firm.Shower supplies and towels were provided, and staff had cleaning equipment to sanitize the showers after each use. Mainline Needle Exchange undertook community outreach and distributed flyers to inform people of the service.But it wasn't that simple. The showers were closed for more than two weeks because they weren't used.Jeff Karabanow is a professor at Dalhousie University and one of the directors of the Dalhousie Social Work Community Clinic. (CBC)Jeff Karabanow was not involved in the project, but is a director of the Dalhousie School of Social Work community clinic, and studies populations experiencing homelessness.He said in order for a project like this to work, the voices of the people from the group most affected must be included from the start.""They're living this experience, and they have very thoughtful and eloquent kind of experiences to what they need and what kind of supports would work, where they will work, and what kind of resources are most important to kind of help them survive homelessness.""Clients consulted for feedbackTen clients were surveyed by Mainline after the pilot project ended, and brought up four main issues.Most people said the location was inconvenient and not easy to access without transportation. Another issue was the weather. By the time the shower opened, it was cold out and people preferred to stay in their tents or shelters.""Resources tend to be used best when they're extremely accessible and they're in the world of the people who are going to be using them,"" Karabanow said.Lack of privacy was also mentioned. The fact that the shower trailer was in a field, quite visible from the road and nearby buildings was noted as a concern.Mainline's clients also said they had other options for bathing that were more accessible than the Dartmouth location, like using a shower at a friend's house or using the sink in a public washroom.This rack card was distributed by Mainline staff to people who are homeless in an effort to promote the shower service. (Halifax Regional Council)Mainline staff were also consulted for the report, and they raised two additional issues with the project.The first was the standalone nature of the showers. They were isolated from other necessary services and supports.Staff also said they didn't have enough time to spread the word about the showers given there was no fixed opening date. Problems securing a location and getting the shower up and running pushed the opening back by a month.RecommendationsThe report made suggestions on how to improve such a project going forward, starting with the idea that a shower facility must be housed in a brick-and-mortar building that also provides other supports and services. Some of the people consulted said they used the Adsum House/Out Of The Cold Community Organization showers on Gottingen Street for this reason.Other recommendations included undertaking the project in warmer months, in a location close to where people who are homeless are staying. If this is not possible, the report suggested providing transportation like a shuttle service or dedicated bus pass.The report's final recommendation was that while the project was well-intentioned, more community engagement is needed in such a process.Karabanow said though a project of this nature is just a ""band-aid"" solution and doesn't mitigate the need for safe and stable housing, it could be tried again.""I think some of the recommendations are extremely thoughtful,"" he said about the report.

CBC;Rancid hotdogs, urine puddles among repeated complaints about for-profit homeless shelters;"Six rooming houses in St. John's operate as a last resort shelter for people experiencing homelessness. At this one, on Cookstown Road, a tenant was allegedly killed by a man staying at the shelter late last year. (Malone Mullin/CBC)Sour-tasting hotdogs. Pizza Pockets and rotten eggs for breakfast. Locked laundry rooms. Puddles of urine on the floor.All are among the complaints made to the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation in the last three years from tenants of the province's for-profit shelter system: a smattering of rooming houses in St. John's owned and operated by four companies.The owners of the rooming houses — six of them in total — are paid on a nightly basis to provide tenants with bedding, household items, working appliances and three meals a day.But documents obtained by CBC News through access to information legislation show clients repeatedly complaining about a lack of food, broken windows and doors, and sanitation, painting a picture of an emergency housing system that leaves the city's most vulnerable choosing between homelessness and, at its worst, life-threatening danger.In the emails provided to CBC, one shelter client said they were unable to attend work for three days because they couldn't access the laundry room to clean their clothes.In another case, a non-profit worker observed ""mice running around"" and a smoke detector that seemed ""to be broken and in pieces,"" and urged N.L. Housing to find the affected client a bed in a non-profit shelter.Another government worker told N.L. Housing that a client was provided with so little food they had been sleeping as much as possible to avoid hunger pangs — a complaint the worker said she'd heard regularly over the years.This excerpt from an access-to-information request describes how rancid food was offered to private-shelter clients. (Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation)A client who was served ""sour"" hotdogs for supper told N.L. Housing that they were too afraid to tell the shelter operator about the spoiled food for fear of being kicked out into the street. Others said they were given Pizza Pockets for breakfast, and one person said an egg sandwich they'd been provided was ""green.""The complaints about food and hygiene surface repeatedly in the emails to N.L. Housing from 2019 to the present.Some of the complaints also conveyed serious safety concerns.A mother and her baby, staying in one room in January, fled the shelter after feeling unsafe with two male tenants outside their bedroom door. When she returned a few days later, she found the two men in her room, with her belongings still inside.Another complained of being attacked with a syringe, and an email to N.L. Housing noted police had visited the residence three times in under a week.Late last year, the alleged threats of violence occurring at these shelters culminated in death.On Dec. 27, a 42-year-old woman staying at a private shelter on Cookstown Road was allegedly killed by another tenant.She was found by police inside the shelter, fatally wounded, and died before reaching the hospital.'These are preventable deaths'Another act of violence marred the city's for-profit housing system in 2019, when a 23-year-old man died outside a private shelter on Bond Street.He wasn't a client at the shelter, which has since closed, but locals told CBC at the time they'd witnessed several fights and assaults outside its doors.That death sparked discussions about creating a set of standards for private shelters, such as the ones in force in Toronto , says Doug Pawson, head of End Homelessness St. John's — but nothing was ever done.Doug Pawson, executive director of End Homelessness St. John's, says for-profit shelters need more oversight. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press)""These are preventable deaths,"" Pawson sighed. ""It shouldn't take a death to lead to the implementation of shelter standards.""Pawson points to private shelters as a necessary element of the province's housing system as it stands, a safety net that prevents the most vulnerable from ending up sleeping outside.But, he says, people using shelters shouldn't be left to fend for themselves.""A lot of folks leave a [public] shelter and go to a bedsit, in a dilapidated rooming house that has folks who are maybe not attached to any services,"" Pawson said.""It's not really good for folks' quality of life. And I think if we don't have enough services for people, we're just going to see this cycle continue.""Standards en route, minister saysUnlike a public shelter, private rooming houses aren't staffed or supervised. Nobody's there regularly checking in.The Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation, which is responsible for overseeing emergency housing, initially wouldn't grant CBC News an interview about private shelters, nor provide any written documentation about safety standards for those shelters.Social Development Minister John Abbott, who oversees the provincial housing system, agreed to a followup interview request last week.Abbott told CBC News that his department acts on complaints immediately and ""[holds] the operator accountable"" for substandard food or amenities.Children, Seniors and Social Development Minister John Abbott says he's working on a set of provincewide shelter standards. (Terry Roberts/CBC)He also addressed the problem of repeated complaints about safety.""We do need to step up our surveillance, our inspections,"" he said.Abbott says his department is working on a set of standards for shelters. He couldn't offer a timeline of when those might be implemented, but said the province's housing system has been met with high demand in recent months.""There is a growing need for shelters,"" Abbott said. ""And we're seeing this fall and winter that the number of people requiring shelters [has] increased significantly from this time last year.""Affordable housing the answer: NDPA shelter operator contacted by CBC News described the difficulties of running a rooming house occupied by a rotating door of people often grappling with medical or legal issues.The operator said clients often steal glassware and bed sheets and break appliances, doors or windows. He suggested his clients end up in for-profit housing as a last resort, when nowhere else can take them in.But the province's interim NDP leader wants to eliminate these rooming houses altogether.Jim Dinn, also the MHA for St. John's Central, sent a budget request to the Liberal government in January. The party's top priority is funding more low-income housing and getting rid of unsupervised rooming houses paid for by the province.""The vulnerable people who are there probably need more support than what the landlords and the owners of these for-profit shelters are charging for,"" Dinn said.Together, the 44 beds available in the for-profit system in St. John's cost the provincial government $1,026,493 last year.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador";On Dec. 27, a 42-year-old woman staying at a private shelter on Cookstown Road was allegedly killed by another tenant.Standards en route, minister saysUnlike a public shelter, private rooming houses aren't staffed or supervised.Social Development Minister John Abbott, who oversees the provincial housing system, agreed to a followup interview request last week.Jim Dinn, also the MHA for St. John's Central, sent a budget request to the Liberal government in January.Together, the 44 beds available in the for-profit system in St. John's cost the provincial government $1,026,493 last year.;['johns', 'houses', 'repeated', 'private', 'shelter', 'complaints', 'hotdogs', 'housing', 'cbc', 'urine', 'homeless', 'rooming', 'st', 'shelters', 'puddles', 'rancid', 'forprofit', 'system'];-0.026561032863849747;neutral
CBC;Pakistan's parliament votes in Shehbaz Sharif as PM after Imran Khan's ouster;"Pakistan's parliament chose a more Western-friendly politician, Shehbaz Sharif, as prime minister on Monday, completing the ousting of predecessor Imran Khan in a political crisis that has sparked street protests and a mass resignation of lawmakers.Sharif's election brings to a close a week-long constitutional confrontation that reached its climax on Sunday when Khan lost a no-confidence vote, although the country is likely to remain prone to political and economic turbulence.Shehbaz, 70, who has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician, is the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif.Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan's military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy in the country of 220 million people.After the vote, Sharif vowed to tackle an economic malaise that has seen the rupee hit an all-time low and the central bank implement the biggest hike in interest rates in decades last week.""If we have to save the sinking boat, what we all need is hard work, and unity, unity and unity,"" he said in his maiden speech to parliament.""We are beginning a new era of development today.""Khan's party walks outJust minutes before the vote, legislators from Khan's party resigned en masse from the lower house of parliament in protest at the expected formation of a government by his political opponents.""We are announcing we are all resigning,"" Shah Mahmood Qureshi, former foreign minister and vice-president of Khan's party, told the assembly.

(Saiyna Bashir/Reuters)The younger Sharif emerged as the leader of a united opposition to topple Khan, a former cricket star who has claimed that the United States was behind his downfall, which Washington has denied.Sharif said in an interview last week good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan's prickly ties to Washington.In his maiden speech, he also spoke of improving relations with neighbours India and China.""We want good relations with India but a durable peace can't be possible without Kashmir's solution,"" he said, referring to the contested Himalayan territory the countries have fought several wars over.He said his government will speed up construction of the $60-billion US China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) — a part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.A supporter of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) holds a party flag with images of Shehbaz Sharif and his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif outside the parliament house building in Islamabad on Monday. (Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images)Political turmoilNo elected prime minister has completed a full term in Pakistan since it won independence from colonial power Great Britain in 1947, though Khan is the first to be removed by a no-confidence vote.Nawaz Sharif was barred by the Supreme Court in 2017 from holding public office and subsequently went abroad for medical treatment after serving just a few months of a 10-year jail sentence for corruption charges.The military has ruled the country for almost half its nearly 75-year history. It viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won election in 2018.But that support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of military intelligence chief and economic troubles that last week led to the largest interest rate rise in decades.Khan remained defiant following his defeat in parliament. Thousands of his supporters in several cities held protests against his ousting that went on until Monday's early hours.""There can't be any bigger insult to this country,"" Khan told reporters on Monday at the prospect of Shehbaz Sharif being elected.";"Pakistan's parliament chose a more Western-friendly politician, Shehbaz Sharif, as prime minister on Monday, completing the ousting of predecessor Imran Khan in a political crisis that has sparked street protests and a mass resignation of lawmakers.Shehbaz, 70, who has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician, is the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif.Pakistan's ousted prime minister, Imran Khan, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Islamabad in 2021.A supporter of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) holds a party flag with images of Shehbaz Sharif and his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif outside the parliament house building in Islamabad on Monday.""There can't be any bigger insult to this country,"" Khan told reporters on Monday at the prospect of Shehbaz Sharif being elected.";['pakistan', 'votes', 'sharif', 'prime', 'shehbaz', 'nawaz', 'pakistans', 'imran', 'khan', 'khans', 'minister', 'relations', 'parliament', 'party', 'ouster'];0.07141873278236914;neutral
CBC;'A perfect opportunity': Canadian scientists back at sea on U.S. research vessel;"Canadian scientists are back at sea this spring monitoring ocean climate conditions on the East Coast thanks to a data- and ship-sharing agreement between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.The collaboration will enable ship-challenged Canada to carry out the first spring survey of its Atlantic zone monitoring program in three years.The twice-yearly missions measure biological, chemical and physical conditions from the Gulf of Maine to the Labrador Sea — information that tracks climate change in the ocean and helps manage fish stocks worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The ship, the money, the dealWoods Hole is supplying the research vessel Atlantis and $1.5 million Cdn in crew time as well as instruments for survey work off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.Canada gets Atlantis until the end of May and will pay Woods Hole $5.1 million Cdn.DFO will collect and share data for scientists at Woods Hole.""This collaboration builds on decades of collaboration between U.S. and Canadian scientists, trying to understand the dramatic fluctuations that we're seeing in the ocean environment off of our shores,"" says Dennis McGillicuddy, chief scientist at Woods Hole.Atlantis was made available to Canadian scientists to monitor ocean climate conditions from the Gulf of Maine to the Labrador Sea. (Lindsay Beazley/Department of Fisheries and Ocean)For Canada, the arrangement solves an immediate problem caused by the abrupt — if unsurprising — retirement of Canada's aging oceanographic research ship CCGS Hudson in January.In recent years, the 59-year-old Hudson was frequently unavailable because of mechanical problems.A catastrophic motor failure last fall led the Canadian Coast Guard to decommission Hudson rather than spend between $12 million and $20 million on refits that could put it out of service until the end of 2023.Bells and whistles""We were really fortunate to be able to have this collaboration with Woods Hole on such short notice,"" said Lindsay Beazley, an aquatic science biologist with DFO at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Nova Scotia.Last week, Beazley completed one leg of the mission on board Atlantis off the Scotian Shelf.Atlantis has all the bells and whistles, including five laboratories and what's known as an Imaging FlowCytobot.The submersible instrument takes very high-resolution images of phytoplankton from streams of water samples that are continuously fed onto the ship. The images are then fed back to shore where software identifies the phytoplankton — doing in minutes what would take a person several hours.""That was a really exciting aspect of this mission,"" said Beazley. ""That system has opened up an avenue of automated monitoring that we had not used within DFO and on our surveys in the past.""'It's a big deal'That Canada got the ship was fortunate.

We already had problems, but it's come to the forefront in the last two years.""Public health measures to try to curb the spread of COVID-19 have sown a stark divide in Mackenzie County, the least vaccinated region in Alberta.Residents and local leaders say friendships have ended, arguments have erupted in shops, and government projects have been unable to move forward amid disagreements over masking, vaccines and other pandemic responses.""It's like the Hatfields and McCoys,"" High Level real estate agent Sylvia Kennedy says in a nod to the famous feuding families of 19th-century American lore.Real estate agent Sylvia Kennedy compared the friction in the county to the Hatfields and McCoys, the famous feuding families of 19th-century American lore.

In addition to High Level, it is home to the hamlets of La Crete and Fort Vermilion as well as to four First Nations.The Alberta government says just under one-third of the county's residents are fully vaccinated and about 38 per cent have had their first dose.The province could not provide a breakdown of vaccination rates for individual towns and First Nations. High Level's mayor, after speaking to several businesses and health workers, estimates three-quarters of the town is fully vaccinated.The Beaver First Nation says 60 per cent of people living on the two reserves it manages are fully vaccinated.McAteer says her town has become ""a pariah"" because it enforced public health measures — sometimes through its own bylaws when the provincial government lifted rules — while businesses in neighbouring towns made headlines for defying them.The Chamber of Commerce in La Crete, an hour's drive from High Level, organized a bus to Ottawa as part of the so-called freedom convoy challenging government restrictions. Some protesters stopped in High Level for a few days to demonstrate against local restrictions.The animosity between High Level and the county peaked in February when the county's council passed a motion to stop working with subcontractors and businesses that had a vaccination policy for employees.

CBC;Elections Ontario offering more options for voting other than in person on June 2;"Elections Ontario is encouraging residents to request mail-in ballots or take advantage of extra days of advanced voting this year with the intention of thinning polling station crowds on the province's first — and hopefully only — provincial election day amid COVID-19.Political parties are currently making pandemic campaign plans and contingency arrangements as the official campaign start nears, but the body that administers Ontario's elections has had a possible pandemic election in its sights for a long time.Chief electoral officer Greg Essensa wrote to the chief medical officer of health in the summer of 2020 asking for a task force, and the two offices have been meeting regularly since then, he said. Elections Ontario is taking the advice of the top doctor as well as looking at how other jurisdictions have run elections over the past two years.When voters show up on June 2, they will see floor signage for physical distancing, Plexiglas screens, hand sanitizer and masks available — face coverings won't be required of voters or staff but will be supplied for those who want one.But Essensa is hoping many voters consider avoiding ballot boxes on June 2 altogether.""I think one of the things that we're really trying to do this election is really look at flattening the curve of the vote,"" he said in an interview.""Traditionally in Ontario — it has always been this way — probably 85 to 90 per cent of those who vote, vote on election day ... we want electors to vote when it's convenient for them, when the time is right for them, ensuring that they can come and vote in a safe, secure fashion. Really, that's our ultimate goal.""Advanced voting to last 10 daysThis year, there will be 10 days of advanced voting, up from five, Essensa said, and the local returning officer can move the poll location. It could be held for a few days in one community, then a few days in another community in the riding, which will be particularly helpful for rural areas, he said.As well, Elections Ontario has a new online process to apply for a mail-in ballot. People can sign up from May 4 to May 27 and the local returning officer has to have the ballot by 6 p.m. on election day.Other provinces that have held pandemic elections have seen significant increases in demand for voting by mail, Essensa said.Ontario only had about 10,000 people vote by mail in the 2018 election, but this year it will likely be far more. In last year's federal election, 300,000 of the mail-in ballots came from Ontario, Essensa said.On the campaign trail, the NDP is still planning to prioritize in-person events for leader Andrea Horwath, but will have a number of public health measures in place, said the party's executive director.On the campaign trail, Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath says all candidates and any volunteers who will interact with a member of the public are fully vaccinated.

But, again, our preference and our priority is certainly to have the leader meet with Ontarians in their communities.""Parties pledge to follow public health rulesPlanning is still underway, but many events will likely look like a rally Horwath held last Sunday — outdoors with masks required, Watson said. All candidates and any volunteer who will interact with a member of the public are fully vaccinated, she said.When canvassing, the party is ""strongly encouraging"" candidates and volunteers to stay masked, Watson said. Recently, one incumbent candidate tested positive for COVID-19 a day after door knocking in her riding. She and others in that situation will adhere to all isolation guidelines, Watson said.The party also plans to have a COVID compliance staff member as part of the central campaign, she said.""We believe that it's our shared responsibility to mitigate risk, and our primary goal is to ensure that activities are safe for the volunteers and the campaigners, the candidates and for the members of the public who are interacting with them,"" Watson said.The Liberals came under fire from some supporters for a recent indoor event at which candidates appeared unmasked, though public health rules were followed.

Winning the Masters was beyond his hopes.""I never made it this far. It was just a dream of being here and competing,"" Scheffler said in Butler Cabin, moments before Hideki Matsuyama helped him into the green jacket.

McIlroy could only hope that Sunday pressure at Augusta National might get to Scheffler.No chance. Not on Sunday. Not the last four days. Not the last two months.""You get on those hot streaks, and you just got to ride them out because they, unfortunately, don't last forever,"" Justin Thomas said.

Scheffler overcame a nervy moment early in the round by chipping in for birdie. He delivered key putts to keep Cameron Smith at bay and never looked rattled, even as he was swatting at short putts at the end.McIlroy was the runner-up. It was Smith who felt as though he let one get away. The Aussie was still in the game, three shots out of the lead, when he dumped his 9-iron in Rae's Creek on the par-3 12th hole for triple bogey and ended his hopes.""Just a really bad swing at the wrong time,"" Smith said.Smith closed with a 73 and tied for third with Shane Lowry, who birdied the 18th for a 69.Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., was the top Canadian at the Masters.

(Matt Slocum/The Associated Press)Scheffler joined Ian Woosnam in 1991 as the only players to win a major — the Masters in both cases — in their debut at No. 1 in the world.Everyone should have seen this coming. Scheffler won the Phoenix Open in a playoff on Super Bowl Sunday. He followed that with a comeback win at Bay Hill to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He rose to No. 1 in the world by winning the Match Play two weeks ago in Texas.And now this.Scheffler, who finished at 10-under 278, won $2.7 million US from the $15 million prize fund. That brings his total to $8,872,200 over his last six starts.Scheffler's big moment came early in the round, and it was no less significant.Starting the final round with a three-shot lead, he watched Smith open with two straight birdies to the cut the deficit to one, and then Scheffler's approach from the pine needles left of the third fairway came up short and rolled back down the slope.His pitch was racing toward the hole when it banged into the pin and dropped for an unlikely birdie, and a two-shot swing when Smith from the same position made bogey.No one got closer than three the rest of the way. Only the contenders changed.Smith's hopes end on 12th holeThe 12th hole remains the most riveting par 3 in golf, the scene of more collapses than comebacks. Smith became the latest victim.Coming off birdie at No. 11, his shot was still in the air when he let his club slip through his hands and he slowly closed his eyes twice as it splashed into Rae's Creek. The next shot wasn't much better, but at least dry, and Smith's hopes ended there with a triple bogey.He was three behind standing on the 12th tee. Three holes later, he was eight back.From there, any hope resided with McIlroy. All he needed to complete the career Grand Slam was to match the best final round in Masters history and get some help from Scheffler. He only got one of those and had to settle for his first silver medal from Augusta.Not that he didn't create some Sunday magic. McIlroy went bunker-to-bunker on the 18th hole, leaving himself right of the green and aiming some 25 feet right of the flag. It rode the slope all the way into the hole, setting off one of the loudest roars of the week.Morikawa followed him in from the same bunker, different angle, and McIlroy could only laugh.""This tournament never ceases to amaze,"" McIlroy said. ""That's as happy as I've ever been on a golf course right there. Just having a chance — and then with Collin, we both played so well all day — and for both of us to finish like this, I was just so happy for him, too.""I've never heard roars like on the 18th green.""The best ones were saved for Scheffler.Scheffler still had five holes in front of him, with no evidence he was going to be anything but the smooth, smart operator who seized control on Friday in the toughest conditions to build a five-shot lead and never lost it.";1 ranking for Scottie Scheffler looks even better in a Masters green jacket.1 Scheffler claims victory at Masters Duration 2:21 American Scottie Scheffler finishes the Masters at 10-under par for his fourth tournament victory in six starts.He shot a final round 70 and finished tied for sixth at 3-under for the championship.Corey Conners celebrates his putt on the 18th hole during the final round on Sunday.All he needed to complete the career Grand Slam was to match the best final round in Masters history and get some help from Scheffler.;['final', 'tournament', 'major', 'hole', 'mcilroy', 'victory', 'championship', '1st', 'scheffler', 'scottie', 'round', 'masters', 'win', 'smith', 'wins'];0.14452685724237452;positive
CBC;Buffalo, N.Y., police officers cleared of wrongdoing after shoving elderly man to ground at protest;"An arbitrator has ruled that two police officers in Buffalo, N.Y., didn't violate the department's use-of-force guidelines when they pushed a 75-year-old protester to the ground in June 2020, during racial injustice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.The episode drew national attention when a news crew captured video of Martin Gugino being shoved by officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski in downtown Buffalo, as crowd control officers in riot gear cleared demonstrators for an 8 p.m. curfew.Gugino, who was pushed backward, started bleeding after hitting his head on the pavement and spent about a month in hospital with a fractured skull and brain injury.Buffalo police initially said in a statement that a person ""was injured when he tripped and fell,"" before video of the incident was made public.In a decision Friday, arbitrator Jeffrey Selchick wrote, ""Upon review, there is no evidence to sustain any claim that Respondents [police officers] had any other viable options other than to move Gugino out of the way of their forward movement.""Gugino lies on the ground after he was shoved by police officers in Buffalo, hitting his head on the pavement, on June 4, 2020. (Jamie Quinn/Reuters)The level of force used by the officers was justified because Gugino refused to comply with orders to leave the scene, was acting erratically and walked directly in front of McCabe, according to Selchick.""The use of force employed by Respondents reflected no intent on their part to do more than to move Gugino away from them,"" he wrote.McCabe and Torgalski were suspended without pay and arrested within days of the incident, but last year a grand jury declined to indict them and charges were dropped.A lawyer for Gugino, who has sued the city, told the Buffalo News that the ruling has no bearing on the lawsuit.""We are not aware of any case where this arbitrator has ruled against on-duty police officers, so his ruling here on behalf of the police was not only expected by us but was certainly expected by the union and city who selected and paid him,"" Melissa Wischerath told the newspaper.WATCH | Elderly man shoved and injured by Buffalo police in incident caught on video.

Just as you wouldn't have a campfire if the hazard level is high, she said, people could adjust their behaviours, such as limiting contacts or wearing masks, based on the COVID-19 hazard level.People 'confused' about what to doIn Peterborough, Ont., the local public health unit has already launched a version of that idea.""People at this juncture in the pandemic are confused. They know that we're entering a new phase, but they don't know what to do.

CBC;Can owning a dog be a 'selfish' pursuit? This academic thinks so;"Digging into the stories of dogs in American literature led Molly Labenski to realize a disconnect in our relationship to canines.""I think over the last few decades we've developed a bit more of an entitlement when it comes to our relationship with dogs,"" said Labenski, who is finishing her PhD in English at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.Her deep dive into classics like Old Yeller — the story of a devoted dog who saves his human family on numerous occasions but gets a bullet in his head after contracting rabies — reveals a pattern in literature where dogs are discarded once their usefulness to humans subsides.She says this attitude reflects our real-world relationship to dogs and other animals, arguing that people want them in their lives as ""accessories"" that can easily be discarded.Author and professor emerita Josephine Donovan argues animals have a standpoint on the way they're treated. She adds that humans should pay attention to that standpoint when deciding how to treat animals. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)Labenski points to the high demand for so-called designer dog breeds, while thousands of dogs in shelters need good homes, as a clear example of that.These designer dogs include mixed breeds such as goldendoodles (half golden retriever and half poodle) and cockapoos (Cocker spaniel/poodle), which are favoured because they don't shed as much, or pomskies (husky/Pomeranian), which are convenient for people who want smaller dogs.""It's at the point where we've got designer dogs customized so they can come in any colour, any pattern, any size,"" said Labenski. ""The word 'design' is perfect — you can design a dog in a way that really reduces them to more of a commodity than it does a companion.""According to statistics from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Canadian Humane Society , in 2019 nearly 400,000 shelter dogs were euthanized across North America.""If we really love dogs, we would be trying to help ones that already exist rather than creating ones for our weirdly specific needs,"" said Labenski, who adopted an Australian shepherd shelter dog during the pandemic.""I think pet-keeping has become largely a selfish pursuit,"" she said. ""We get dogs specifically for personal reasons that don't really benefit the dogs, whether it's to assuage our own loneliness or if you want to get more exercise, then getting a dog is the way to make that happen. Couples often get dogs to sort of test the waters before they have children.""High demand for dogsPets of all kinds have been in high demand during the pandemic. According to research by conducted by Abacus Data , about 900,000 more Canadians became new pet owners during the pandemic. (This data was collected through an online survey of 1,500 Canadian adults between June 4 and 9, 2021.)Some animal shelters have noted an increase in pets being given up.""It's been insane the number of surrenders we get — it's tripled in the time I've worked here,"" said Cassandra Ferrante, who for the past six years has been working as a dog trainer at Dog Tales, a private animal shelter and rescue near King City, north of Toronto.""We get at least five to 10 [surrender] applications a day. We can't even keep up with the surrender requests.""Cassandra Ferrante is one of roughly 50 employees caring for dogs at Dog Tales, a rescue shelter that sits on a 20-hectare farm north of Toronto. She’s pictured here with Goji, who has since been successfully adopted. (Submitted by Cassandra Ferrante )Every year, Dog Tales is able to find adoptive homes for about 350 surrendered and rescued dogs. But for Ferrante, who now manages the kennel, dealing with the surrender requests is difficult.""It's the least favourite part of my job, I would say, because I can't relate to people who are surrendering their dogs… I can't understand how someone can just dispose of their dog, no matter how hard it is, if you're moving or whatever.""What we can learn about dogs in literatureFor her PhD work, Labenski combed through canonical works of American fiction in which dogs are discarded, killed or left for dead. She's identified troubling dog scenes in classics such as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye.The working title of Labenski's thesis is ""Who Let the Dogs Die?: Domestic Animal Abuse in American Fiction.""""For me, the dog characters in literature are just as important as the human ones,"" said Labenski. ""We think we have this great relationship with animals, but the reality of the fiction shows us otherwise…. The dog is really often ignored as an individual in itself in literature.""Labenski draws on a framework known as animal standpoint theory, which aspires to analyze the literature from the animals' perspective.Author and professor emerita Josephine Donovan argues animals have a vantage point that humans need to respect, both in the real world and in literature. (Carl Court/Getty Images)One of the founding figures of this theory is Josephine Donovan, professor emerita in the department of English at the University of Maine and the author of The Aesthetics of Care: On the Literary Treatment of Animals.""[Animals are] considered commodities,"" said Donovan. ""And under the law, they're considered property. And in science, they're considered objects for laboratory experimentation. And so to the extent that literature comes to stabilize the objectification of animals, that's what animal standpoint criticism is [discouraging].""Condemning violence against animals in literature is one thing, but Donovan goes further, arguing that animals should not be used in fiction without regard to their own point of view.""Animals should not just be used as literary devices,"" said Donovan. ""So often, they're just used as symbols or metaphors, or in some way to comment on the state of mind of the human character, and the animal herself is discarded and then basically ignored.""Donovan, whose forthcoming book is called Animals, Mind and Matter, would like to see literature that would ""give the animals more voice.""""My overall goal is to break through this objectification and change the whole cultural notion so that we see animals as living subjects who have points of view, who have minds, who have feelings, who have thoughts, who have inner worlds, needs and wishes.""Animals 'rich as metaphors'While intrigued by certain aspects of animal standpoint theory, fellow author and dog lover Richard Teleky isn't convinced.""I'm genuinely puzzled about [Donovan's] attitude towards the imagination,"" said Teleky, editor of an anthology called The Exile Book of Canadian Dog Stories.""If you are too judgmental about the way writers in the past have used animals, you do a disservice both to the writer and to the past … you're going to wipe out much of Western literature.""Booker-prize winning author Yann Martel also finds the animal-vantage-point approach restrictive.""The usefulness of animals for me is precisely that they're very rich as metaphors,"" said Martel, whose novels Life of Pi and Beatrice and Virgil rely on animal characters to tell the story.Yann Martel — probably best known for his Booker Prize-winning novel Life of Pi — relies heavily on animal characters in all of his books, which serve in highly symbolic or metaphorical roles. (Geoff Howe/Vintage Canada)""We tend to be very cynical about our own species. We tend not to be cynical about animals, especially wild animals. We imbue animals with a sense of wonder, of marvel, and that's very useful for a storyteller, because then I can take an animal character and right away get beyond your natural cynicism.""As for the violence toward animals in the novels Labenski is studying, Martel argues it can inspire empathy, adding that writing stories strictly from an animal vantage limits the imagination.""Stories are only useful for us. Animals don't have stories,"" said Martel, pointing out, for example, that telling the story of a slug from the slug's point of view serves no purpose for that creature. ""And it'll be quite dull for us, because a slug has a very limited intellect.""Labenski remains committed to advocating for animals — even fictional ones.""There'll always be a bit of a discrepancy between the opinions of literary critics and authors,"" she said. ""I would say [to authors] to consider animals more fully than they are right now. It is easy to make animals ornamental in literature, because they are rather ornamental in our lives already.""Guests in this episode (in order of appearance):Molly Labenski is a Queen's University PhD student in the English department.

CBC;Freeland's budget leaves out a number of major Liberal campaign promises;"Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland tabled her second federal budget Thursday promising a return to ""fiscal responsibility"" after years of big COVID-related spending.It's a noticeably thinner budget that left some of the Liberal Party's major 2021 election promises on the cutting room floor. A number of those commitments — most notably more money for health care, mental health and long-term care, and more support for seniors — were slated to roll out starting in this fiscal year.Freeland said the pandemic blew big holes in the federal budget and it's now her job to ""review and reduce"" spending and revert to Canada's ""proud tradition"" of spending within set limits now that the worst of COVID-19 is behind us. The budget is projecting $31 billion in net new spending over the next five years, a fraction of what the government has allocated in past budgets.""Our pandemic deficits are and must continue to be reduced. The extraordinary debts we incurred to keep Canadians safe and solvent must be paid down,"" Freeland said.Freeland's stated commitment to fiscal prudence caught some observers by surprise, considering the party's election platform — released just eight months ago — made no mention of belt-tightening. In fact, the party's fiscal and costing plan from the election platform called for much more spending in some priority areas.""We've got an issue here and it's not about money. It's about politics,"" Armine Yalnizyan, one of the country's lead progressive economists and an Atkinson Fellow on the Future of Workers, told CBC News.""It's incomprehensible because we have no affordability problem. We've had no trouble selling our bonds. In fact, our bond sales are oversubscribed. It isn't that we couldn't borrow more or raise taxes.""They are appealing to 'blue Liberals' and Bay Street to de-fang some of their opposition from the right. It's a political ploy to buy peace with the corporate chattering class.""The Royal Bank of Canada's headquarters on Bay Street, in the heart of the financial district in Toronto. The Liberals were promising a much higher surtax on financial institutions. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)Yalnizyan said the government's decision to slash a promised tax hike on Canada's largest banks and life insurance companies was an unnecessary sop to corporate Canada.In the election, the Liberals promised a 3 per cent ""surtax"" on those large financial institutions. Instead, the budget offers a 1.5 per cent increase to the tax rate paid by these companies on taxable income.Yalnizyan, a strong advocate for the national child care plan the government eventually implemented, said she was most troubled by a gaping hole in the government's plan for the ""care economy"" — a sector she said is in ""chaos"" after a debilitating pandemic left the country grappling with massive labour shortages in health care, child care and long-term care.""People are leaving the sector in droves, the conditions are appalling and there wasn't a word about that in this budget,"" she said.WATCH | Finance minister discusses recent federal budget: Freeland calls latest budget 'the first in a four-chapter book' Duration 10:19 Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland speaks to CBC's chief political correspondent, Rosemary Barton, about the federal budget she delivered. 10:19No new money for long-term careWhile the budget allocates billions in new spending to rein in a hot housing market and help with the transition to a cleaner economy, it was all but silent on a major election promise: billions of dollars to support the country's long-term care system, which has been particularly challenged by COVID-19.Research suggests Canada's LTC facilities have recorded some of the worst COVID-19 fatality rates in the world.To address this, the Liberal platform promised $6.7 billion over the next four years for that file — a cash injection to ""improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes and beds.""In August 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also promised to spend $1.8 billion over four years to raise the wages of personal support workers (PSWs) to at least $25 an hour and train 50,000 more of them to prop up a faltering system.Personal support worker Olivia Proudfoot sits with Israel Gorlick at Springhurst Manor in Toronto in December 2020.

(Evan Mitsui/CBC)Freeland's budget also doesn't include another promised policy for seniors — a $500 increase to the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) for low-income seniors and $750 for couples. That nearly $4.2 billion commitment was supposed to take effect this fiscal year  it's not accounted for in the budget.Liberals promised billions to hire more doctorsDuring the election, the party promised $3.2 billion for the provinces and territories to hire 7,500 new family doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners starting in this fiscal year.It was money earmarked to expand access to primary care in a country where, according to StatsCan data, 14.5 per cent of the population — about 4.6 million people — say they do not have a regular health care provider.As Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos announced last month, the Canada Health Transfer — the money Ottawa sends to the provinces each year to cover some of the cost of running the health care system — will get a one-time cash infusion of $2 billion to help clear surgical backlogs.A health-care worker transports a deceased COVID-19 patient to the hospital morgue from the intensive care unit at the Humber River Hospital in Toronto in January (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)Beyond the pre-planned yearly increase to the transfer — and a plan to implement some sort of dental program — the government hasn't allocated any additional funds this fiscal year to the health care system.The dental care program — which will cost about $5.3 billion over five years and some $1.7 billion for every year after that — is a budget line-item but there isn't a plan yet to implement it. Officials told reporters in a budget briefing Thursday that the work will get underway sometime this year.HealthCareCAN, an industry group representing health care organizations and hospitals, said it was pleased to see Freeland propose some tweaks to the temporary foreign worker program to help with health care staffing.But the group said more is needed ""urgently"" to ""shore up our overwhelmed health care system.""""This budget does not effectively address what our health care system has undergone for the last two years. Canadians can no longer wait for the political leadership to build a modern health care system that provides timely access to high-quality care, regardless of where you are in the country. They want and deserve action now,"" said Paul-Émile Cloutier, the group's president and CEO.Registered nurse Stephanie Flores, who has been redeployed from the operating room to the intensive care unit, looks out the window in the ICU unit at the Humber River Hospital in Toronto in April 2021. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)Asked about the absence of new health spending, Freeland said no budget can be expected to do everything at once. She also said more funding could come after negotiations with the premiers — almost all of whom have said this is a top priority.""We need to work with the provinces and territories to get this right. It's a complicated challenge,"" Freeland said. ""It's something that takes a lot of time.""Many of the premiers have said repeatedly that new money for the existing health care system should be Ottawa's focus — not an expansion through new programs like dental care and pharmacare.Mental health care transfer missing from budgetCanada is in the throes of a mental health crisis.The pandemic-driven lockdowns, restrictions, limits on social gatherings and forced social distancing have been disastrous for this country's collective mental health — prompting unprecedented levels of loneliness, depression, anxiety, stress and unease among some people.According to figures supplied by the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), a stunning 40 per cent of all Canadians have reported a deterioration in mental health during the pandemic — with people with pre-existing health conditions (61 per cent), the unemployed (61 per cent), people between the ages of 18-24 (60 per cent) and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people (54 per cent) reporting numbers much higher than the national average.COVID-19-related restrictions have exacerbated mental health concerns and addiction issues across Canada but the problem is particularly acute in the country's rural and remote areas because access to services is so poor in so many communities, says a report recently released by the Mental Health Commission of Canada.The isolation and stress brought on by the pandemic has led to unprecedented levels of depression and other mental disorders. (Mrmohock/Adobe Stock)The Liberal Party identified this as an issue in the last election. Speaking at a campaign stop in August, Trudeau said ""the past 18 months have been really tough"" and Canadians ""deserve the right support and that includes on mental health.""Trudeau promised to create a new Canada Mental Health Transfer, with an initial investment of $4.5 billion over five years.That money isn't in this budget. Instead, the document said the government ""intends to engage with the provinces and territories"" before possibly allocating funds to such a program.Michel Rodrigue, the president and CEO of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, told CBC News he was pleased to see the government commit some new funds to the problem.While there's no funding for a mental health transfer, the budget does include $140 million over two years to keep the ""Wellness Together Canada"" online portal functional.

We are facing a parallel pandemic of mental health and substance use issues combined with an opioid crisis. There's a lot of work ahead to really respond to the needs out there.""Asked if more federal money should have been earmarked now, given that deteriorating mental health is such a pressing problem, Rodrigue said, ""That's a very astute analysis.""";"It's a noticeably thinner budget that left some of the Liberal Party's major 2021 election promises on the cutting room floor.HealthCareCAN, an industry group representing health care organizations and hospitals, said it was pleased to see Freeland propose some tweaks to the temporary foreign worker program to help with health care staffing.But the group said more is needed ""urgently"" to ""shore up our overwhelmed health care system.""Mental health care transfer missing from budgetCanada is in the throes of a mental health crisis.We are facing a parallel pandemic of mental health and substance use issues combined with an opioid crisis.";['promises', 'health', 'campaign', 'care', 'fiscal', 'major', 'mental', 'cent', 'money', 'number', 'budget', 'promised', 'freelands', 'leaves', 'liberal', 'billion', 'spending'];0.08044279039177002;neutral
CBC;Canada needs workers — so why aren't more companies hiring the neurodivergent?;"The founders of a job fair for those with autism don't only want to find careers for an untapped workforce — they also hope employers will realize these highly skilled job seekers can help solve a national labour shortage.""People with autism are very much capable of working and they are some of the best employees,"" said Neil Forester who, along with his business partner Xavier Pinto, created the Spectrum Works Job Fair that ran Friday.Now in its sixth year, the job fair has grown from having 150 attendees to almost 2,000 job seekers with autism, all looking to connect with recruiters and hiring managers at major tech, finance, hospitality and retail companies across the country. Though it's been held in various cities, the job fair was a virtual event this year and last.Getting companies to take part, though, has been a struggle.Of the 10,000 employers Forester and his team have reached out to in the last six years, just 40 companies took part in this year's job fair.""The majority of the time we don't get any response,"" Forester said.The creators of the fair say they understand there is a wide range of abilities across the autism spectrum and, while perhaps not every person with autism is employable, both Forester and Pinto are confident a large portion of this community can and wants to work.And Forester questions why more employers aren't looking at this neurodiverse talent pool to help solve the labour shortages that so many companies are experiencing.A national labour shortageIn the last quarter of 2021, Canadian employers were looking to fill 915,500 jobs, up 63 per cent from the year before, according to Statistics Canada.And with the current unemployment rate so low, ""virtually all industries are bumping up against labour shortages,"" wrote Royal Bank economist Nathan Janzen in an economic update this week.Even with the demand for workers, employment barriers remain for Canadians with autism.Data compiled by the Public Health Agency of Canada found that in 2017 just 33 per cent of Canadian adults with autism reported being employed compared to 79 per cent of adults without a disability.Forester said he was unaware of just how few neurodiverse employees there are in the workforce before he started the job fair.""I just didn't realize how big of a problem this was or how big of an issue this was to the community,"" he said.Javier Herrera, a business systems analyst with an insurance company based in Vancouver, attended the Spectrum Works Job Fair last year and got a job offer. (submitted by Javier Herrera)Javier Herrera is one of the comparatively few Canadians who are both employed and living with autism.He attended the Spectrum Works job fair last year and got a job offer.""It was overall a very positive experience. I met not only recruiters, but also other facilitators, coaches, government agencies, non-profits, you name it,"" said Herrera who now works as a business systems analyst with an insurance company based in Vancouver.Herrera is encouraged to see that some employers purposefully seek out people with autism, but he feels that ""as a society we are still doing baby steps"" to get more people who are neurodiverse into the workforce.The 'Big Four' are buying inThat said, there are some companies specifically tapping into this talent pool, including two of the so-called ""Big Four"" accounting firms.In the last few years, Ernst & Young has made strides in diversifying its hiring strategy.The multinational launched the Neurodiversity Centre of Excellence in Toronto in November 2020, with a goal of recruiting employees with autism, ADHD or other sensory and cognitive differences.""We're dying for talent as an organization,"" said Anthony Rjeily, a partner at Ernst & Young and the company's neurodiversity program national leader. ""So we wanted to see if there was any talent pool out there that we could potentially tap into.""Since the launch of the program, the company has recruited 45 neurodiverse employees to their Toronto, Vancouver, Halifax and Montreal offices — and plans to expand recruitment in other cities.Rjeily said the initiative has more than paid off, noting the retention rate among neurodiverse candidates that the company has hired is 98 per cent.""The level of creativity, the innovation, the productivity that they are able to deliver is incredible,"" he said.Under Ernst & Young Canada’s neurodiversity program, program leader Anthony Rjeily says the firm has hired 45 staff with autism, ADHD, or other sensory and cognitive differences. (Craig Chivers/CBC)Mohit Verma was one of the first people Ernst & Young hired in 2020 through the neurodiversity recruitment program.""At EY my work revolves around certain sub-competencies such as automation, data science and, to some extent, blockchain,"" Mohit said in an interview with CBC News. ""So far I have been part of five to six main projects.""Deloitte Canada is another corporation with an eye on hiring the neurodiverse.In an attempt to better understand the barriers and workplace needs of neurodiverse workers, the accounting giant teamed up with Auticon Canada, a global technology consulting firm that employs people with autism and recently did a survey along with Deloitte of what the needs of employees with autism might be.Changing the interview processThe survey, 'Embracing neurodiversity at work: How Canadians with autism can help employers close the talent gap,' was done between July and October 2021. It included 454 respondents with autism who completed the survey online, as did seven companies that had neurodiversity in their workforces were interviewed over videoconferencing.In their survey, they found that 41.7 per cent of respondents were underemployed, meaning they were working on a part-time, contract or temporary basis or were doing jobs that were ""under their educational capabilities,"" said Roland Labuhn who is a partner with Deloitte Canada.One of the most eye-opening findings was that the hiring process itself could be a major barrier, as 40 per cent of those polled said the job interview was a ""great challenge"" for them.""The people we surveyed felt that the interview was a trick or scary,"" said Labuhn, who worries that the typical job interview process could eliminate some highly qualified candidates with autism.With a goal of getting better at both recruiting and retaining neurodiverse workers, companies like Deloitte and Ernst & Young are trying to change the interview process so that it focuses more on competence rather than how a candidate might behave in a certain scenario.That kind of accommodation provides hope to people like Pinto and Forester.The inspiration for their job fair came out of Pinto's concerns about his son's future. Xavi, 12, is on the spectrum and is ""so creative,"" his father said.He's ""really focused on what he wants done.""And seeing more employers begin to sign up for the job fair gives him hope that he's helping to create a world in which his son can go after his dreams.";Though it's been held in various cities, the job fair was a virtual event this year and last.And Forester questions why more employers aren't looking at this neurodiverse talent pool to help solve the labour shortages that so many companies are experiencing.Javier Herrera, a business systems analyst with an insurance company based in Vancouver, attended the Spectrum Works Job Fair last year and got a job offer.He attended the Spectrum Works job fair last year and got a job offer.The inspiration for their job fair came out of Pinto's concerns about his son's future.;['neurodivergent', 'canada', 'autism', 'hiring', 'interview', 'workers', 'young', 'neurodiverse', 'employers', 'job', 'neurodiversity', 'needs', 'arent', 'fair', 'companies', 'talent'];0.22289656771799626;positive
CBC;Ukrainian couple used Kyiv parking garage as a bomb shelter before fleeing to Canada;"For a second night, Oleksandra Samorodova and Irene Ilchanka sat inside their small car parked in a Kyiv underground parking lot — a site that had become a makeshift bomb shelter since the invasion by Russia — and set out one important goal once they escaped.""This second night was a sleepless night and we were tired and we talking and I said, OK, let's get married when we get out of here,"" Ilchanka said.Those marriage plans are currently in the works, as the couple, along with Samorodova's seven-year-old son Noah, their two cats and a dog settle into a new life in Toronto, more than 7,000 kilometres away from the deadly violence in Ukraine.With the help of friends in the city, they were able to secure an apartment in a Beaches-area home where they can stay for free until September. Although they came to Canada with almost nothing, local donations have supplied them with enough food and clothing, as well as toys for Noah, who has enrolled in a school down the street.Noah, 7, who fled Ukraine with his mother and her partner is pictured in his bedroom in a donated Toronto apartment on April 1. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Samorodova and Ilchanka are now trying to help others in Ukraine navigate their way to safety. Both animal lovers, they are also attempting to figure out how to find Canadian homes for the pets that have been abandoned in Ukraine by fleeing residents.One bag and the clothes on their backsOn Feb. 24, the couple was forced to flee their own apartment in downtown Kyiv, waking up around 5:30 a.m. to the sound of explosions.""We don't know what to do because we can't believe that this is really happening,"" Ilchanka said. ""And then we realized ... that it began, the war has begun.""The couple lived on the 25th floor of their apartment building and were concerned for their safety. They gave themselves 35 minutes to quickly pack up one bag, using half of it for pet food and documents, and with only the clothes on their backs left the apartment.They picked up Noah, who was with his father at the time, and headed to an underground parking lot downtown, where many other city residents had relocated to shelter from the bombing.The parking garage had electricity and a washroom and Samorodova, Ilchanka, Noah and the pets were forced to sleep inside their Mini car. But the explosions they heard at night made them realize they weren't safe and that they needed to leave the area.Hundreds crowd into the train station in Kyiv to evacuate the city. (Submitted by Oleksandra Samorodova and Irene Ilchanka)When they emerged from the lot, they couldn't believe how much the city had changed in just two days.""Not because of bombing, but because of the whole atmosphere,"" Ilchanka said.""It was downtown and it was empty,"" Samorodova added.They drove about a half hour away, stayed with friends for a few days, but felt that they needed to head west, and decided to take the evacuation train.The scene at the station located in central Kyiv was ""catastrophic,"" Ilchanka said. ""There were burned out cars, and all these people with animals and their backpacks going to the train station.""I've never seen the train station so crowded. It was people everywhere and everybody trying to get to any direction.""The train itself was overcrowded, with no food or water available. They also had to turn off the lights so the train wouldn't be seen from the sky, Ilchanka said.Kyiv passengers crowded into train. (Submitted by Oleksandra Samorodova and Irene Ilchanka )Fleeing to CanadaThe trip took them 18 hours and arrived in Rakhiv, in western Ukraine. From there, they crossed the border into Romania, and decided that Canada would be their final destination. Noah was born there  Samorodova had lived in Toronto before and had received her Canadian citizenship. Meanwhile, Ilchanka had a tourist visa allowing her to stay for six months.""It was a rational decision,"" Ilchanka said.Samorodova was a radiologist back in Ukraine but also worked in a medical IT company, a job she's able to continue in Toronto. Ilchanka worked for an advertising firm but is currently looking for work, and has applied for a work permit.They want to eventually get their own apartment, but for now are grateful for the support they have received.""We were shocked.

Yuen Pau Woo opposing a Senate motion to condemn China for genocide against the Uyghur minority. A previous version stated Woo said Canada should avoid criticizing China for its human rights abuses. In fact, Woo said Canada should avoid condemning China.March 24, 2022A clarification notice was added to The National on a story about the CRTC's decision to ban the Russian news channel Russia Today (RT) in Canada. The piece quotes Slava Levin, the CEO of Ethnic Channels Group Limited, raising concerns about removing channels based on their political leanings. This was intended solely to convey Levin's concerns about the process followed by the CRTC. The story should have made it clear that Levin, who was born in Ukraine, does not support RT and favours the channel's removal in Canada. The clarification notice is available on the website and on YouTube for the segment, which aired on March 16, 2022.March 10, 2022A correction notice was added to a story on The National about the Chinese government promoting social media influencers with pro-government views in an attempt to improve perceptions on how it handles human rights issues. The story contained comments from Daniel Dumbrill, who gave his opinion about influence campaigns in China as an observer, not a participant. He said he's not a paid participant in any state campaign and this context was not included in the story. The correction notice is available on the website and on YouTube for the segment, which aired on Feb. 6.March 10, 2022An on-air correction was broadcast on CBC Radio's The World This Hour regarding a story about Breonna Taylor, the Black woman who was killed in her apartment during a police raid in Louisville, Ky. The report, which aired on March 3, 2022, incorrectly said Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was wanted on drug charges. In fact, Walker was not facing any charges and was not named in the search warrant that police used to enter Taylor's home.March 7, 2022On Feb. 10, 2022, in a report about the protest convoy, CBC Radio's The World This Hour incorrectly said GoFundMe ended a fundraiser for the protesters over questionable donations to the group. In fact, GoFundMe ruled the fundraiser was in violation of their terms of service, which prohibits the promotion of violence and harassment.Feb. 28, 2022CBC News added a clarification note to a number of stories that referenced an incident involving Ukrainian border guards and Russian forces at Snake Island. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky initially said 13 border patrol officers at the outpost died after refusing to surrender, other Ukrainian officials later contradicted him and said they believed the guards were alive. The updated stories can be found here, here and here.Feb. 25, 2022An on-air correction was broadcast on The National to acknowledge that archive images of a truck belonging to Titanium Trucking Services were mistakenly used to illustrate a story about a blockade attempt of the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ont. In fact, there is no evidence Titanium Trucking Services was part of the attempt and the company says it has not been involved in the recent protests or blockades. A correction notice was added to the segment, which aired on Feb. 16 and is available on the website and on YouTube.Feb. 15, 2022CBC News corrected this story, published on Feb. 15, about the resignation of Peter Sloly as Ottawa's police chief. A previous version mischaracterized a Globe and Mail report about Sloly. The story was changed to indicate that, according to the Globe story, Sloly was not known in police circles for being heavy-handed.Feb. 2, 2022A clarification notice was added to Power & Politics on an interview about a truck convoy protest headed to Parliament Hill. A question was asked about the possibility Russian actors could be fuelling or instigating the protest, without referencing experts' concerns that during the current tension over Ukraine, Moscow could use its cyber and disinformation capabilities to ""sow confusion"" among Ukraine's allies during a crisis. The clarification notice is available on the website and on YouTube for the Jan. 28 version of the show.Jan. 20, 2022A clarification notice was added to The National about footage used to illustrate WestJet cancelling flights due to the pandemic. Archival footage shot in April 2020 was aired without indicating the date on screen. The notice is available on YouTube for the Jan. 18 version of the show.Jan. 13, 2022CBC News corrected this story, published on Jan. 11, about compensation for survivors of residential schools. The story incorrectly said descendants of Indian residential school day scholars could apply for $10,000 in compensation. In fact, relatives and descendants can only apply in cases where the day scholar is deceased, no estate is appointed and they are the highest priority heir.Dec. 27, 2021Two lines which appeared at the bottom of the screen on CBC News Network regarding waning vaccine protection did not meet CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices. They omitted context, including recent research showing boosters would decrease the risk of infection by five times.Dec. 5, 2021An on-air clarification was broadcast on CBC Manitoba's local radio newscasts about a protest in Winnipeg by people accusing Israel of human rights violations against child prisoners. Additional context was aired, including that a government spokesperson has denied allegations to similar criticisms in the past, stating Israel does not engage in torture, humiliation, or solitary confinement to achieve confessions.Nov. 22, 2021An editor's note was added to the top of this column about the experience and reflections of an information officer with Elections Canada, originally published under the First Person category on Oct. 25. It has been revised with deeper context and to clarify the writer's reaction was to some conservative candidates and their policies, and not broadly to conservative parties. The column was changed to the Opinion category after an editorial review. The piece was also updated to correct a detail about a Conservative Party candidate and a description of Bill 21 in Quebec.Oct. 28, 2021An editor's note was added to the top of this story, published on Sept. 11, about vaccine hesitancy. A previous version featured only one expert's opinion on the possible reasons behind vaccine hesitancy, and the story was updated to better reflect a range of views. It also previously included comments from the organizer of a vaccine mandate protest that were unrelated to the focus of this story. The organizer had not been interviewed about the psychology of vaccine hesitancy and should not have been included in the piece.Oct. 12, 2021An on-air clarification was broadcast on CBC Edmonton's TV programs and posted to social media about footage that was included in an Oct. 7 story about COVID case modelling in Alberta. The story included six seconds of footage showing mannequins in beds in a realistic hospital setting. These images had been shot in September at an Edmonton-area hospital training facility to illustrate the nature of ICU wards and should not have been used out of context in the Oct. 7 COVID story.Oct. 10, 2021An on-air correction was broadcast on The National to acknowledge that images of Boris Yeltsin were mistakenly shown in a story that referenced Mikhail Gorbachev's 1990 Nobel Peace Prize win. A correction notice was added to the segment, which aired on Oct. 8 and is available on the website and on YouTube.Oct. 8, 2021CBC Kids News corrected this YouTube video, originally uploaded in March 2019, about the use of the word Indigenous.

A reference to the net worth of the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians was removed from a section focused on income. This story was also previously updated to correct a tax calculation under the New Democratic Party's proposed wealth tax.Sept. 15, 2021CBC News corrected two stories about Dr. Matt Strauss, who was appointed the acting medical officer of health in Haldimand-Norfolk. The stories, published on Sept. 4 and Sept. 7, incorrectly said Strauss described business owners who open in violation of public health orders as ""heroes.''

The previous title of the video said a Toronto company had lost the stem cells of thousands of children. In fact, the company says the samples were destroyed. The video was uploaded on July 26, 2021 and the title was changed on July 29, 2021.Sept. 3, 2021An editor's note was added to the top of this story, published on Sept. 2. A previous version incorrectly identified 24 schools across New Brunswick as having elevated carbon dioxide levels. In fact, they were the 24 Anglophone West District schools that don't have mechanical ventilation systems.Sept. 1, 2021An on-air correction was broadcast on Ontario Today addressing a number of false statements made on the previous day's program by a guest caller who was an opponent of COVID-19 vaccinations.

A story on the false account was also published.June 6, 2021An on-air clarification was broadcast on The World This Weekend regarding a story about the RCMP's difficulties in recruiting Indigenous officers. The World This Weekend incorrectly reported that recruitment efforts by the RCMP were complicated by the shooting deaths of Indigenous people, such as Chantel Moore, by the RCMP. In fact, Moore was shot and killed by a member of the local police force in Edmundston, N.B.May 13, 2021CBC News corrected this story, published on May 5, about contractors of Irving Shipbuilding arriving from outside of Nova Scotia. The story contained factual inaccuracies and those errors were corrected online, on social channels, radio and TV when additional information was provided to CBC Nova Scotia.April 30, 2021We updated three stories that incorrectly described the AstraZeneca vaccine as 100 per cent effective in preventing the severe outcomes of COVID-19. In fact, the company says the vaccine has 100 per cent efficacy to prevent those outcomes. Effectiveness refers to outcomes in ""the real world,"" while efficacy refers to outcomes in clinical trials. The corrected stories can be found here, here and here.April 14, 2021CBC News corrected this story, published on April 13, that said a patient hospitalized with COVID-19 had received two doses of the vaccine more than 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. In fact, the second dose was received less than seven days prior to symptom onset and would not have been considered active yet. The headline was also changed to better reflect the overall information in the story.March 31, 2021CBC News has added a correction notice to an investigative documentary by The Fifth Estate called 13 Deadly Hours: the Nova Scotia Mass Shooting, available on the website and on YouTube. The documentary said officers jumped out of a cruiser outside the Onslow fire hall and began firing. In fact, the person interviewed said it was not a cruiser and she believed it was a civilian vehicle. Since then, Nova Scotia's Serious Incident Response Team has found that it was an unmarked police vehicle.March 22, 2021We updated this story, first published on May 8, 2020, because the original article did not accurately clarify that the COVID-19 pandemic led to the changed visiting hours, and that the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre was following Ministry of Health guidelines that were updated due to the pandemic. The story has also been updated to add references to restrictions imposed by the Timmins and District Hospital, and to clarify that CBC Thunder Bay's research was based on a small random sampling of hospitals across Ontario and not a formal survey.March 22, 2021CBC News updated this story, originally published on April 23, 2020, which did not accurately reflect how the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre was planning for the pandemic. The story has been updated with exact wording from the 2017 Pandemic Influenza Plan. A previous version of this story also said patients with a poor prognosis being admitted to hospital would be left to die. In fact, that is not stated in the plan nor did CBC Thunder Bay practise due diligence in contacting the hospital for clarification on any aspect of the 92-page document. The story did not comply with CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices.March 18, 2021We amended this story, posted on March 16, about the discovery of new Dead Sea scrolls to clarify where the scrolls were found.March 16, 2021On CBC Radio's The World This Hour, in a March 3 story regarding the International Criminal Court's decision to open up a war crimes investigation on Israel and Palestinians, we incorrectly reported that the court would investigate the Palestinians for the kidnap and murder of three Israeli soldiers in May 2014. In fact, the three Israelis were not soldiers and they were killed on June 12, 2014. That date is outside the scope of the court prosecutor's investigation, which is examining allegations since June 13, 2014.March 16, 2021We removed the content of this Associated Press story, published on Jan. 9, 2021, after AP said it had reported an erroneous account of a phone conversation between U.S. President Donald Trump and an investigative official from the state of Georgia about the U.S. election results. The corrected story is here.March 5, 2021We corrected this story, first posted on March 1, that said a police cadet was a witness to ""the Taser death of Matthew Fosseneuve at the hands of police."" In fact, while Fosseneuve died following an encounter with police during which he was Tasered, the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba said his death ""resulted from pre-existing conditions to which no police action unlawfully contributed in any degree.""March 5, 2021We removed the content of this story, originally published on April 30, 2020, regarding financial statements from the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. It contained misleading information that had not been verified by CBC Thunder Bay prior to publication, as is required by our journalistic standards and practices.March 1, 2021We updated this story, first published on Feb. 26, to correct a statistic that said two per cent of those who identified themselves as Black or African American received doctorates in health sciences in 2017.

In fact, Augustine was the first female Black MP. Lincoln Alexander was the first Black MP, elected in 1968.Feb. 12, 2021We updated this article, first published on Feb. 11, that reported on plans by the Manitoba government to purchase a Canadian-made COVID-19 vaccine.

CBC;Are The Thousands of Dollars Spent on Lessons For My Kid Worth It?;"I remember sitting in the audience of my daughter’s debut ballet recital. My parents tagged along for the experience. Because who could resist watching a throng of toddlers-turned-ballerinas promenading in kitty cat costumes?It's the kind of moment I had dreamed of since I became a mother — the thrill of sitting in an auditorium filled with other excited parents. Watching memories unfold before our eyes as our kids flourish doing something they love.Only my daughter was just three years old.And she never asked to sign up for ballet lessons. In fact, she had no idea what ballet even was.""What did we expect? Swan Lake?""So rather than pirouetting across the stage, she lumbered onto it. And instead of dutifully executing the graceful choreography, she looked totally perturbed at being thrust in front of wild-eyed parents. While we enthusiastically waved in our seats while snapping pics, she didn’t dance a step. Instead, she stood frozen in the blaze of the floodlights.But we oohed and awed over the cuteness anyway. Because what did we expect? Swan Lake? She was practically a baby. She had years ahead of her to blossom into the high-kicking hoofer of our dreams. She just needed more lessons.Natalie Romero's kids are heavily involved in after-school sports, but she doesn't want it to be at the expense of their childhood.What's in a dance class?Then the big kids came out for their chance to tread the boards. I elbowed my husband to pay close attention. This was the moment we’d see where all those classes, dance shoe purchases, costume rentals and recital tickets were heading! How all those Saturday morning lessons would ultimately pay off!""While the performers had oodles of enthusiasm, some didn’t have much rhythm.""And from the wings leapt a dozen preteen performers. And oh, how they kicked and twirled and leapt with the energy only those cracking the double digits can muster. The music built to a dizzying climax. The house exploded into thunderous applause followed by an uproarious extended standing ovation.But uh, between you and me? Most weren’t exactly Broadway-bound. While the performers had oodles of enthusiasm, some didn’t have much rhythm. A couple had trouble remembering the routine while another was two steps behind.Not being related to anyone currently on stage, my dad leaned over and whispered, “So that’s what $10,000 of dance lessons buys you?”He was, of course, joking, but he had a point. Dance lessons or piano lessons or basketball clinics don’t provide your child with talent. They just give them the skills to explore.In the fall of 2020, CBC Kids News talked to teens about returning to extracurricular activities that were paused by the pandemic and what that meant for them.It's not all about talentSo, I've wondered, why bother? Why make the investment if your kid isn’t particularly gifted at an activity? If the money spent on all these lessons won't produce a prima ballerina or concert pianist or even the next Billie Eilish, wouldn’t the money go to better use in an RESP or even my RRSP?""Why make the investment if your kid isn’t particularly gifted at an activity?""It's something I've thought about as I look around my home at the relics of discarded lessons of the past. An electric piano collects dust in our living room, begging for someone to tickle its ivories. A neglected ukulele is buried under a pile of mitts in our hallway, crying for its strings to be plucked. Abandoned singing books around here have transitioned into makeshift coffee coasters. A pair of outgrown ballet slippers languishes in a drawer dreaming of coming out of retirement.Yet, I believe all those lessons have been completely worth it.Music lessons, dance classes, art lessons and swimming courses have been investments in my daughter — not as an artist or performer or athlete — but as a person.I’m trying to help cultivate an engaged citizen who has an appreciation for things outside of her own comfort zone. An individual who knows how to collaborate and who can work on a team. A young lady who has explored different parts of her imagination and pushed herself physically.And if she isn’t great at it or doesn’t love it, that’s OK. The time and money expended have helped hone her interests and gain important insights into her true interests, abilities and passions in life.I only wish all my investments delivered such positive returns.";And she never asked to sign up for ballet lessons.While we enthusiastically waved in our seats while snapping pics, she didn’t dance a step.Not being related to anyone currently on stage, my dad leaned over and whispered, “So that’s what $10,000 of dance lessons buys you?”He was, of course, joking, but he had a point.Dance lessons or piano lessons or basketball clinics don’t provide your child with talent.Music lessons, dance classes, art lessons and swimming courses have been investments in my daughter — not as an artist or performer or athlete — but as a person.;['thousands', 'kid', 'dance', 'performers', 'dollars', 'money', 'spent', 'parents', 'kids', 'worth', 'isnt', 'didnt', 'watching', 'lessons', 'ballet'];0.18531468531468528;positive
CBC;What's 'good sex,' anyway?;"(Credit: iStock/Getty Images)There are so many factors, from positions to partner type, that can contribute to a person's idea of ""good"" sex. Finding out what brings you pleasure should be an adventure, but if you're feeling lost, Shan Boodram is ready and willing to be your guide.Boodram, a Canadian intimacy educator, describes herself on Instagram as ""kinda like Dr. Ruth meets Rihanna."" A bestselling author and podcaster who favours frank discussions, she's a natural fit as the narrator of CBC's new six-part docuseries The Big Sex Talk . The show unpacks notions of sexuality, explains new vernacular, and debunks myths surrounding sex with the input of experts, culture vultures and everyday Canadians.As the voice of the docuseries, Boodram leads viewers on explorations of monogamy and polyamory  asexuality  the link between sex and technology  and gender identity, among other things. Ahead of the show's debut, we asked Boodram to share her thoughts on what ""good sex"" really means — and how to get it.The biggest misconceptions about 'good sex'""I think the biggest misconception about what 'good sex' is, is that it's a finite destination,"" said Boodram. ""The real truth is good sex is a result of sexual creativity and innovation. And it's something incredibly personal."" Variables including frequency, activities and boundaries all affect a person's definition. ""For a very long time, we've had this idea that there's this rinse-and-repeat model of what sex should look like in people's lives. And very few people live up to that, [and] as a result, have felt like they've been left out of the 'good sex' conversation.""Defining 'good sex' for yourselfBoodram defines ""good sex"" as sex positivity. ""Which is giving yourself the space to explore the depths and potential of your humanity through your sexuality, and giving people — you know, specifically your partners — the space to do the same,"" she said. While she acknowledges our human preoccupation with doing or saying the ""right"" thing, Boodram encourages us to fully embrace the sexual experience, from making ""crazy sounds and silly faces"" to sharing what gets you going. ""Sex is supposed to be like the ultimate freedom, the ultimate expression of you,"" she said.The influences that distract usAccording to Boodram ""heteronormative sexual social scripts"" keep us from figuring out and going for what we really want. And, spoiler alert, they're everywhere: from pornography to mainstream TV shows.These repetitive norms even infiltrate the tales friends share. ""They curate their stories to fit within what they think is … the socially acceptable sex life,"" said Boodram. This impacts exploration and reinforces expectations. ""People who exist outside of that [narrative], in terms of their desires, their sexual identity, their orientation … they don't have the luxury of seeing what feels good for them reflected back to them.""The effects of pornographySpeaking of pornography, Boodram has some thoughts on its potential. ""What's unfortunate is that we think about pornography as a monolith,"" Boodram said, adding that many of us probably associate the term with a specific website rather than considering it a genre of film. And every genre is supported by a spectrum of contributions.""There is a rise in ethical porn,"" she said, citing independent content she consumes that's produced by women and aims to eliminate the exploitative aspects of the business. ""I think that that's very educational. It's an incredible way for me to affirm that some of my desires and my kinks outside of the norm — or outside of being vanilla — are actually normal, and they don't make me deviant.""On the other hand, mainstream porn doesn't have a great track record of reflecting authentic experiences, said Boodram. ""Porn is to sex what WWE wrestling is to fighting. It's overly dramatized. It is unrealistic. You could never do the moves that you see on TV in an actual fight or else you [would] get your ass kicked.""Both forms of entertainment also tend to follow a certain script. ""It's to the benefit of one person.… the other person, essentially, is just there as a role-player to facilitate the [first] person's pleasure and greatness.""How to explore your desiresWhen it comes to exploring what you really want in bed, Boodram suggests checking out the work of Rafaella Fiallo and Dalychia Saah, two U.S.-based Black sex educators who run the Instagram page @afrosexology_ .""They have this really beautiful list that I think is a really great starting point for people. Because often when it comes to sex, we think about the to-dos … 'I want to do BDSM,' or 'I want to try voyeurism' … you think about it in terms of activities. And what the Afrosexology women [have] suggested is, instead, thinking about [what you want] to feel."" Whether the answer is empowered, dominant or degraded, comparing notes with a partner can lead to discovery, said Boodram.Shy about asking for what you want?Firstly, recognize that you're far from alone in this department. ""Everybody's uncomfortable talking about the things they don't know. If you got me in a room, [and] we're talking about internet connection, I'd be sweating buckets,"" Boodram said. But practice and exposure to a topic builds confidence, and sex talk is no different.""If you feel nervous, I would probably start to look for some low-hanging fruit or, you know, easy ways to practice,"" she said. ""Maybe it's with your friends rather than with your partner to start. Maybe it's [in] a chatroom … you can kind of get a feel for how to utilize language that is descriptive for you and see how people respond back to it.""It also helps to start considering the topic as an evolving conversation. Approaching it as an ongoing dialogue is what is at the heart of good sex and good communication, Boodram said.How to explore something new in a long-term relationshipPair your curiosity about a new form of sexual expression with consideration for your other half. In other words, don't spring a request on them during sex. Boodram uses the topic of fluid play as an example: ""[Someone decides] that they really want to get into fluid exchange play of some kind. And then they watch tons of videos on it, and they talk to their friends about it. They might read a couple blogs. They might listen to a podcast … then, in the act, they're like, 'Hey, I want to do this thing.' And they expect their partner to be exactly where they are, even though this is a new idea presented to this person for the first time ever, in, like, a heightened emotional state.""Allowing your partner to warm up to an idea, being patient while they educate themselves and being prepared to progress slowly — or not at all, if they choose — can reduce any potential for alienation and support a deeper connection. ""The joy is in the journey, the shared journey,"" Boodram said.A long sex lifeBoodram suggests checking in with yourself regularly to assess your evolving needs and desires, gaps in knowledge you'd like to fill, new curiosities and new boundaries, too. ""I could just be saying that because I am on, like, a hyper track of evolution because I just had a baby — and I'm pregnant again. And so my sex life, and my sex drive, and my sexual desires and needs are literally changing by the hour.""One episode of The Big Sex Talk focuses on the intersection between sex and aging. ""[That] episode was one of my favourites, just because the stories were so good,"" Boodram said, noting that traditional sexual scripts and discussions of sex don't typically include older people. ""This is about a lifelong journey, [a] lifelong experience. And these are people who've been on that journey … who are revolutionaries … now, maybe we're getting more comfortable with the idea that sex is about wellness, and everybody should have accessibility to wellness, regardless of age.""The episode questions the existence of a ""sexpiration"" date and seeks to confirm that the best is yet to come. ""In generations past, there was a belief system that after a certain age, we just don't want to see or hear about it,"" said Boodram. ""I love the fact that this [episode] was challenging that. And also showcasing it in a sexy way … like, 'Oh, wow … that's aspirational for me. Like, I actually look up to that.'""This interview has been edited for length and clarity.";"Ahead of the show's debut, we asked Boodram to share her thoughts on what ""good sex"" really means — and how to get it.The biggest misconceptions about 'good sex'""I think the biggest misconception about what 'good sex' is, is that it's a finite destination,"" said Boodram.And very few people live up to that, [and] as a result, have felt like they've been left out of the 'good sex' conversation.""Defining 'good sex' for yourselfBoodram defines ""good sex"" as sex positivity.Approaching it as an ongoing dialogue is what is at the heart of good sex and good communication, Boodram said.";['really', 'sexual', 'think', 'talk', 'boodram', 'dont', 'sex', 'good', 'partner', 'idea', 'whats'];0.19983766233766234;positive
CBC;$8-billion budget boost in military spending draws mixed reviews;"Defence spending was a key area of focus in the federal budget tabled this week, given that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had prompted a renewed emphasis on security in NATO countries.But depending on whom you ask, the spending commitments laid out by Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Thursday are either woefully too little or they're thankfully smaller than they could have been, preserving funding for other budget areas.The key figure is a plan to boost defence spending by $8 billion over five years, bringing the country's 2026-27 defence spending to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, up from 1.39 per cent currently.Of that $8 billion, $6.1 billion is slated to go toward modernizing NORAD, the defence partnership between Canada and the United States, while $500 million is earmarked to help Ukraine. There will also be another amount set aside to meet Canada's commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.But retired lieutenant-general Andrew Leslie was critical of the government's plan.""What she's telling [the Department of] Defence to do is to do more with less,"" said Leslie, a former Liberal MP for Orléans, a suburb of Ottawa, noting that when the Liberals took power in 2015, they promised $12 billion in defence spending, much of which he says hasn't been spent.He noted that the funding also falls short of NATO's request made to member countries.""They've been asking us to go to two per cent for years — our GDP's the same size as Russia's. And this brings us from 1.3 per cent to about 1.5, but only at the end of five years, if that. So it's worse than I could possibly have feared.""Retired lieutenant-general Andrew Leslie says the government is asking the Department of National Defence to do more with less based on the funding allocated in the federal budget tabled this week. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)""Our government's defence policy — Strong, Secure, Engaged — increases defence spending by over 70 per cent between 2017 and 2026 and places Canada's defence spending, in real dollar terms, sixth among NATO's 30 members in 2020-2021,"" Daniel Minden, spokesperson for Minister of National Defence Anita Anand, said in an email to Cross Country Checkup.""In the short term, Minister Anand will present a robust package to modernize NORAD and to ensure our Arctic sovereignty. Minister Anand is in frequent contact with U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on this matter,"" he wrote.'The system cannot handle more money'Peggy Mason, president of the Rideau Institute, an independent foreign policy and defence think-tank, and former Canadian ambassador for disarmament to the United Nations, said that Canada isn't lagging when it comes to defence spending. However, the war in Ukraine may have led some to expect more money for defence in the budget.""I am quite relieved that it is $8 billion over five years, and I'm further relieved by the fact that ... six billion of it is focused on NORAD modernization,"" Mason said. She added that she hoped the funding for NORAD would improve Canada's ability to monitor the Arctic, ""which is pretty fundamental for sovereignty and security,"" she said.""At the same time, I'd point out that we still have the fundamental problem that the system cannot handle more money — that they're unable to spend what we've already committed to,"" she said.Mason cited figures from the Parliamentary Budget Office that show the Defence Department is under-spending by about $2 billion a year because of delays in equipment procurement.Mason said that to get the country's defence spending to two per cent of GDP, Canada would have to spend an additional $16 billion on defence.""I mean, it's ludicrous. Frankly, it is preposterous that we would do that,"" she said.But for Leslie, he sees it as part of what he calls Canada's ""ever-diminishing role on the international stage.""""I'm very concerned that this relentless focus on social programs to please the voter comes at the expense of national security and international security, because we're not contributing to peace and stability missions anymore, really,"" he said.Defence relies on diplomacy, soft skillsBranka Marijan, a senior researcher at Project Ploughshares, a peace and disarmament think-tank that is part of the Canadian Council of Churches, agrees that Canada hasn't been focusing on peacekeeping missions.""I think generally public support has been for peacekeeping and peace support operations,"" she said. ""But that hasn't been true in a long time, right? Canada really doesn't do peacekeeping much anymore.""Branka Marijan, a senior researcher at Project Ploughshares, says she wanted to see more funding in the federal budget for diplomacy efforts and other soft skills that are also critical to defence and international relations. (Submitted by Branka Marijan)Marijan said there is a ""disconnect"" between the public's perception of Canada as a peacekeeping country and what the country's military does.""There's still very much the perception that we are ... the peacekeepers,"" she said. ""That is not reflective of where we are.""She also said the defence spending levels in the federal budget did not come as a surprise to her based on what had been hinted at before it was tabled.""What's disappointing about it is that we aren't seeing the same kind of investment and the same kind of commitment to, you know, peace-building and diplomacy and humanitarian aspects,"" she said.Marijan pointed out that those kinds of soft skills are needed, for example, in the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine — from building consensus with other countries to helping refugees if they want to come to Canada.""This is something that's going to be relevant beyond this conflict,"" she said.Written by Andrea Bellemare with files from CBC News.

CBC;What we know so far about getting COVID-19 twice in the age of Omicron;"Getting COVID-19 a second time was once considered a rarity. Now, with the more transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.2 spreading throughout the country, reinfections are becoming more common, immunology and infectious diseases experts say.Exactly how common is not clear. Testing is limited across the country and detailed COVID-19 data that's publicly available is also limited.""There is a dearth of testing that's happening and there's some information coming out to suggest that the rapid antigen tests are not as accurate as we hoped against Omicron,"" said Jennifer Gommerman, professor of immunology at the University of Toronto, and the Canada Research Chair in tissue specific immunity.""Prevalence is a difficult question to answer, but we know that there's lots of virus going around.""PCR test-positivity rates, hospitalization figures, and wastewater data in many provinces are showing increased transmission of the virus.And data from around the world do show reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, experts say.""When we think about this idea of reinfection, we have to appreciate we are still facing a virus that has a unique ability to circumvent those early defences from neutralizing antibodies,"" said Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist and assistant professor in medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.Yet, reinfection cases largely do not cause worse symptoms of the disease, said Kindrachuk, who is also the Canada Research Chair in the molecular pathogenesis of emerging viruses.There are many factors as to why someone may be reinfected with the virus, and researchers are trying to get a better understanding of reinfections and what it means during Omicron.PCR testing data in Canada is limited so many Canadians have turned to rapid tests to see if they have COVID-19. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)Reinfections rising in global dataData released by Public Health Ontario last week shows some 11,730 Ontarians have been reinfected with COVID-19 since November 2020.Reinfection, according to Ontario health officials, is when someone has had two lab-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 with evidence that these were ""separate infections caused by different viral lineages.""South African scientists had warned in December that reinfections among people who've already battled COVID-19 appeared to be more likely with Omicron than with earlier coronavirus mutants.A recent rise in reinfections has been seen in parts of the world like the United Kingdom, which had a similar vaccine rollout to Canada.Before Dec. 6, the proportion of daily cases in England thought to be reinfections had been below two per cent for nearly six months.That rate is estimated to have risen to 9.9 per cent as of February, a Reuters analysis of UKHSA data found.In Italy, a spokesman for the National Institute of Health said in February that reinfection cases stood at around three per cent of all infections, up from around 1.5 per cent before Omicron.Why does reinfection happen?There are a lot of factors as to why someone is reinfected with COVID-19, including vaccination status and when a person got a vaccine or infection, said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at University of Alberta in Edmonton.A study done in Qatar published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month found recovering from a previous infection was approximately 90 per cent effective at preventing reinfection from the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants.Protection against reinfection with the Omicron variant was lower at 60 per cent but ""still considerable,"" said the authors.Another important aspect of the risk of reinfection is vaccine-induced immunity.Experts are recommending that people get a booster shot to better protect themselves from COVID-19. (Hannah Beier/Reuters)The strength of immune response will partially depend on a person's age and overall health. The very old, very young, and immunocompromised will have weakened responses, for example.That's why fourth doses are now being rolled out to the more vulnerable populations across the country.And although vaccines have repeatedly been proven effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization, Omicron is still ""quite good at punching through the equivalent of two doses and in many cases, two doses plus infection or three doses,"" said Saxinger.The Dose 24:11 Do I need a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine? COVID case counts are once again climbing in many parts of Canada along with hospitalizations. This week, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine be given to all Canadians ages 80 and up. 24:11It's known that antibodies do drop off over time after someone is vaccinated or infected, said Benoit Barbeau, a professor in the biological science department at Université du Québec à Montréal who studies virology.""So if you've been infected in December or early January, you'd already have less levels of antibodies. It doesn't mean that you've totally lost your protection against infection, but definitely you'll have less protection than say 10 days after being infected,"" he said.The good news is that the immune response generated through vaccination ""is strong enough to keep us from getting really severe disease and ending up in hospital,"" said Gommerman.That's why experts are recommending people get a booster shot for that added protection.As for the Omicron subvariant BA.2, early research out of Denmark hints that reinfections with that strain seem rare.What do we need to learn?Barbeau said as parts of Canada and other countries deal with a sixth wave, more data will emerge on who is getting reinfected and why.""There'll be other variants. The risk of reinfection will always be there,"" he said.But he emphasized that the immunity in the population, whether from vaccines or prior infection, is building up and allowing us to reduce transmission and hospitalization.All of this is happening as research continues into improving vaccines, whether it's adapting to new variants or research into new methods to administer vaccines like through the nasal cavity, he said.""It's very important to continue improving the vaccines.""";"Testing is limited across the country and detailed COVID-19 data that's publicly available is also limited.And data from around the world do show reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, experts say.PCR testing data in Canada is limited so many Canadians have turned to rapid tests to see if they have COVID-19.Protection against reinfection with the Omicron variant was lower at 60 per cent but ""still considerable,"" said the authors.As for the Omicron subvariant BA.2, early research out of Denmark hints that reinfections with that strain seem rare.";['cent', 'know', 'age', 'cases', 'twice', 'getting', 'data', 'research', 'reinfections', 'infection', 'reinfection', 'omicron', 'vaccines', 'far', 'covid19'];0.12117093945016022;positive

CBC;From racy stage shows to 'bushoir' calendar babes, how Indigenous artists are decolonizing sex;"Not everyone would be willing to confess their sexual secrets to a room full of strangers. That's where Kim TallBear and her Indigenous erotica event, Tipi Confessions, comes in.""I confess: my first lesbian experience was with a white person. Even if she couldn't give any land back, she did give me many orgasms,"" says TallBear, reading an anonymous confession written and submitted by an audience member at a show during Toronto's 2019 Queer Film Festival.The crowd hoots, hollers and cheers.Tipi Confessions is a live theatre event, with its co-creators and hosts reflecting on sexual desire and sex positivity through an Indigenous lens. Alongside sexy storytelling and performances, the night is punctuated by the anonymous audience confessions.Some confessions are all about the laughs. Others, about being vulnerable.""I confess, I have often had sex more for others' pleasure than my own. This bothers me,"" read co-founder Tracy Bear at a 2015 event in Edmonton, eliciting a sympathetic ""aww"" from the crowd.Kim TallBear speaks at a Tipi Confessions event in 2017 in Vancouver. (Jun Kamata)TallBear, who is an Indigenous scholar of science, technology and sex at the University of Alberta, created Tipi Confessions in 2015, with Bear and Kirsten Lindquist, as a play on the Texas show Bedpost Confessions.""I think that it provides people an opportunity to sit there in an audience, of sometimes a few hundred people, and realize that we all have these awkward, difficult, hurtful, challenging and joyful moments that we can bring into a conversation about sexuality,"" TallBear told Unreserved's Rosanna Deerchild.And they're not the only ones exploring this. Indigenous creators across several artistic disciplines are rediscovering and reclaiming their sexuality through their work — sometimes for fun, other times as a direct response to the effects of colonialism.That work could take the form of Kanina Terry's Hide Babes Calendar, featuring pinup photos of Indigenous men and women in sexy outfits made of moose or deer hide — a style she dubs ""bushoir.""""Our bodies are sacred. And I think having a beautiful, soft, sacred hide next to them is … for me, it's just such an amazing feeling,"" said Terry, who is Anishinaabe-kwe from Lac Seul First Nation in Ontario.Or Edmonton artist Tashina Makokis, who makes earrings resembling vulvas out of moosehide strips, Swarovski crystals — and thematically appropriate beaver hair.Vulva earrings by Tashina Makokis, made with moosehide, pink moonstones, Swarovski crystals and 'a landing strip' of beaver fur. (Tashina Makokis/Instagram)Indigenous erotica in literatureIt's a more diverse landscape compared to when author and publisher Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm first started looking for Indigenous erotica more than 20 years ago.At the time, she was surprised to find almost none. When she asked writers she knew about the topic, most realized it wasn't even on their radar.Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm is an Anishinaabe writer. In 2003, she released the collection Without Reservation: Indigenous Erotica. (Submitted by Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm )""I'd see a light bulb go off over people's heads when I broached the subject. They would ... start to realize, like, 'Why am I not writing about it?'"" she said.""But when I actually started talking to people, you know, it was just welcomed. People really wanted to have those conversations.""The result of those conversations was Without Reservation: Indigenous Erotica, a collection of poetry and prose by Indigenous writers around the world including Canada, the U.S., Australia and Aotearoa (New Zealand).It's beautiful for us to love each other. It's beautiful for us to love ourselves. - Kateri Akiwenzie-DammAkiwenzie-Damm said she sought out a wide diversity of content for the collection, but she wasn't interested in submissions that were mostly about dominance or violence.""I was really looking for positivity [and] for positive reflections of Indigenous people loving each other,"" she explained.TallBear shares that sentiment, saying that one of the influences behind these stories is a need to break free from the legacy of colonialism, including residential schools in Canada — which erased cultural memories of all kinds.""When we talk about sex and Indigenous people, it shouldn't just be trauma,"" TallBear said. ""It shouldn't just be that it was turned into a weapon of violence by the settler state and all of its horrible institutions. It's also a way to share joy and power among each other and our intimates.""TallBear has researched how European settlers forced their views of gender, marriage and property on Indigenous populations as part of their assimilation efforts.""For them, the heads of households can only be men. Marriages are supposed to be monogamous and heterosexual, and they're supposed to last forever"" — a far cry from some First Nations cultures, she explained, where polyamorous or LGBT relationships were common.Left to right: Co-founders TallBear, Tracy Bear and Kirsten Lindquist speak at a Tipi Confessions event in 2017 in Vancouver. (Jun Kamata)Settlers unfamiliar with these kinds of relationships either described them as ""sexually promiscuous"" or strange — and didn't attempt to learn or record much else about them.""We're missing a lot from the archive, because they wrote down what they saw and they weren't ... capable of seeing everything,"" TallBear said.Reclaiming old traditions to build new onesTerry's path to the spicy side of photography began when she reconnected with a family tradition that had been previously lost.In 2017, she attended a hide tanning workshop in Thunder Bay, Ont. The craft used to be passed down through Terry's family. But the generation that was forced to attend residential schools, including Terry's mother, was never afforded the opportunity to learn that skill — and all the cultural knowledge that goes with it.That workshop set Terry on the path to becoming a skilled hide tanner herself. A few years later, she hit a moment of inspiration during an outdoor photoshoot while wearing lingerie and hide.""It's always just been about, you know, being myself and feeling confident about myself and who I am as an Indigenous woman out in the bush,"" said Terry.Terry says a friend who photographed her coined the term ""bushoir,"" and she loved it. Soon, the idea gained momentum. She collaborated with friends and fellow artists to make the first Indigenous Hide Babes calendar in 2021, with a second out now for 2022.""There's some women, there's some men, there's some awesome hot boys in drag,"" she said of the 2022 edition.A page from Terry's 2022 Indigenous Hide Babes calendar. (Submitted by Kanina Terry)She also has a non-bushoir calendar out this year for those who are looking to celebrate hide art and fashion in a more G-rated, all-ages context.Terry has received a lot of positive reactions to her calendars. But the most poignant review might be from her eldest aunt, who wrote her a letter reminiscing about how she used to tan hides when she was younger.Terry hopes her work helps Indigenous people become more comfortable with themselves and learn more about sex positivity.And Akiwenzie-Damm shares that vision. ""We needed to reclaim that in order to be fully who we are and to recognize that it's beautiful for us to love each other,"" she said.

CBC;She quit university due to an alcohol problem. Now sober, she landed a $35K scholarship;"Laura Eamon was a few months into her first semester at Carleton University in 2011 when she was taken from a residence party to hospital by paramedics.Embarrassed by being carried out in front of her fellow students, her mindset changed when she was discharged and returned to campus in Ottawa.""People are cheering and chanting, and like, 'Oh, my God. You're the girl that got taken by ambulance. You drink as much as I do,'"" said Eamon. ""It was almost like a badge of honour.""It wasn't the only time Eamon, originally from Hammonds Plains, N.S., went to hospital because of excessive drinking.From 2008 to 2013, alcohol was a big part of Eamon's life. Her struggles with alcohol eventually led her to drop out of university.Prestigious scholarshipBut Eamon is now back at university, this time at Saint Mary's in Halifax. Sober for more than eight years, the 28-year-old just landed a prestigious Frank H. Sobey scholarship worth $35,000, one of nine given out annually to undergraduate business students in Atlantic Canada. She has a year left in her studies.As part of her application for the scholarship, which included reference letters, written essays and an interview process, Eamon talked about her sobriety.""I wanted to show that it is a possibility for people to change, for people to grow, for people to survive substance-use disorder,"" she said.Eamon started drinking when she went to C.P. Allen High School in Bedford, N.S., and liked the confidence it gave her. She believed alcohol was part of the package that included new friends, big parties and adventure.'The alcohol sort of took over'Even though Eamon skipped a lot of classes, she kept her grades up. She graduated in 2011, and wanting to go somewhere bigger than Halifax, she decided on Ottawa.""And when I got into university, the alcohol sort of took over,"" said Eamon.Eamon is shown in a photo from her time at Carleton University. Students in residence would wear these red sweaters and they could have their nicknames printed on the sleeve. 'Naturally everyone agreed on my nickname, and I paid actual money to have that branded on my sweater,' she says. (Submitted by Laura Eamon)In her first year, she lived in residence. She failed a few classes and barely scraped by in the others, missing a lot of instruction time along the way.Eamon headed home for the summer with a friend, Kassie Nadler. The two split a place in downtown Halifax, but Nadler left after about a month.""She packed up all of her stuff and said, 'I can't do this anymore. It's impossible to live with you and you're ruining my time here. You are sick and this is too much. Something's got to change. And I'll see you in Ottawa in September,'"" said Eamon. ""And she left.""The experience was a first for Eamon. No one had told her that her drinking was problematic.Nadler told CBC News this was actually the second time she had a conversation like that with her best friend. The previous time was during their first year of university.Then 18, the pair would often head to nearby Gatineau, Que., where the legal drinking age is 18, so they could go to clubs. Eamon would often black out from drinking.""I can't take care of you in those moments where you need me to,"" Nadler told Eamon at the time. ""And I'm not physically capable and I can't make sure that you're safe, and it puts me in an uncomfortable position.""For their second year of university, the pair lived off-campus and had other roommates.Eamon said she knew something was wrong when her roommates were able to balance their studies, work and maintain a social life, but she couldn't.""They were thriving, and I was sad and lonely and sick,"" said Eamon.Within a week, she dropped out. She got a job and worked to pay for her rent and alcohol.Early the following year, Eamon moved home. She continued drinking, couch-surfed and worked a series of jobs in retail and reception when she wasn't calling in sick for the day.""I feel bad for all the customers who I dealt with … I was pretty haggard-looking and rough around the edges, probably cranky all the time,"" said Eamon.Eamon bikes on P.E.I.'s Confederation Trail in the summer of 2021. (Submitted by Laura Eamon)One day that summer in 2013, she woke up in a hotel room and didn't know where she was.She went to her first AA meeting that night and cried the entire time. At the end of the meeting, she had a realization.""How can you go to a bonfire or the beach or, you know, a cottage without drinking?"" said Eamon. ""I was, like, sobbing to this woman, just so concerned — not that I had woken up downtown in a place where I didn't even know existed, but because I was worried about going to the beach without alcohol.""Sober since Nov. 9, 2013Eamon wasn't ready to quit drinking, but on Nov. 9, 2013, she went to AA after she was sexually assaulted.""I knew I didn't want to ever be in a situation like that again if I could help it, and the only thing that I could control was my own actions,"" said Eamon. ""And that's really where my sobriety started.""Eamon has been sober ever since. She said being surrounded by people who had similar experiences helped her maintain her sobriety. Her father was also an important resource. He was also a recovering alcoholic who had been sober since before Eamon was born.Growing up, Eamon attended meetings with her father on his sobriety birthdays.Life without alcohol was different. She didn't have mysterious bruises and pulled muscles and other injuries. Eamon also noticed she suddenly had extra money. It wasn't just the money saved from not buying alcohol  it was things like not buying fast food while drinking or the morning after, and not missing work and wages.Eamon also fell in love.""All of a sudden, I was experiencing joy,"" she said.Eamon is now a stepmom. Her partner has two kids from a previous marriage.She also got a diploma in medical office administration and started working in the health-care system, but she longed for a bigger challenge and applied to Saint Mary's University in 2017 and started attending the school.Needing a 'Hail Mary'She's balanced working in different positions — she's currently a project co-ordinator with the Sackville Business Association — and going to school while taking less than a full course load.Since giving up drinking, it hasn't been all joy for Eamon. Her father died due to cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and her mother had a brain aneurysm, but has fully recovered.Finding the money to pay for school has been another challenge. Needing a ""Hail Mary,"" she learned of the Sobeys scholarship. Looking at the past recipients, she felt intimidated by their success.""And my partner was just saying, you know, 'You're pretty incredible, too. Why don't you apply?'"" said Eamon.Part of the application process included talking about volunteer experience. Eamon's volunteer work includes sitting on the board of the Sackville Rivers Association and acting as the communications chair for the organization, which is the community where she now lives. She's the treasurer of the Saint Mary's University Environmental Society.Eamon is also involved with the Halifax Recovery Society, a non-profit focused on breaking down the stigma of mental health and substance-use disorders.

They've also taken road trips together over the years. While Eamon's confidence has grown, in other ways she hasn't changed.""She was still the same Laura that I met on the first day that I went to Carleton for the group tour, still just funny and outgoing and social and very interested in the world around her and in the people that she surrounds herself with,"" said Nadler.When Eamon learned she had won the scholarship, the celebration was simple: she and her partner got Chinese food.""I think I've turned into a homebody and I'm comfortable with that,"" she said.

CBC;Some insects are disappearing, and that could put humans at risk, says author;"Read Story TranscriptWhile you may wish bugs would buzz off sometimes, climate writer Oliver Milman says we wouldn't want to live in a world without them.""We wouldn't survive there for very long,"" Milman told The Current guest host Duncan McCue.Milman writes for The Guardian in the U.K. and is the author of the book, The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires That Run the World, which will be released in March.While it might not outright be an insect doomsday, Milman says we have seen a dramatic decline in insect populations. Milman referenced a study in rural Denmark, which found a decline of 80 to 97 per cent of insects on hitting vehicles' windshields over two decades, from 1997 to 2017.And a long-term study in Germany that concluded in 2017 found that that annual average weight of flying insects caught in traps has dropped by 76 per cent since 1989.Milman says it's been happening for a variety of reasons, including habitat loss from construction, pesticide use, and climate change, he explained.He said if we continue like this, some insects will disappear, while others will grow.Bugs are essential for pollinating plants such as alfalfa. (CBC)""Mosquitoes [habitat] range is expanding because of what we're doing rather than contracting,"" said Milman.""A lot of [insects] that we are losing, those half a million species that are likely to go down the drain, are [insects] we find kind of beautiful and lovely and useful for us,"" he added, referencing an analysis by two Australia-based scientists, Francisco Sánchez-Bayo and Kris Wyckhuys, that anticipate the dramatic loss in species over the next few decades.He said a world without bugs would have serious effects on everything from the environment to the availability of chocolate and ice cream.For example, we would see more corpses of small animals and feces lying around, as beetles get rid of those for us by eating them.He also said a third of the foods we eat would shrivel up and die without the pollination provided by insects. That includes tiny midges that pollinate the plant used for chocolate, as well as insects that pollinate alfalfa, which cows eat.While some insect populations are on the decline, mosquito population is on the rise. (CBC)""You'd be left with the vegan stuff,"" said Milman.But don't go out and panic buy tubs of ice cream just yet.""Luckily, I don't think we're going to ever see that because I think insects will outlive us on this planet. The issue is that we are creating a world that is changing the composition of insects,"" he said.Soccer-playing bees?Based on some of the abilities insects have, the next time someone tells you to stop ""bugging"" them, you should take that as a compliment. Milman is concerned the reputation of insects isn't matching up with their usefulness and intelligence.Take the humble bee, for example.Bees can be trained to play soccer if given food incentives. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images)""It's been shown that they can count  you can teach them to play soccer. They have incredible logistical abilities to travel between plants,"" he said.Or ants, that can act as paramedics to treat other ants in the colony.What can be done?Milman said countries are already finding replacements for insects. That includes robot bees, or a drone that can pollinate apple orchards.Others are trying to slow down the extinction of insects, like enacting pesticide bans throughout the European Union, or cutting down on light pollution — which may deter some moths from laying eggs and puts other insects at risk of being seen by predators — in Germany.People can plant milkweed, a food source of the Monarch, to help the butterfly. (Evan Buhler/The Canadian Press)But other solutions are surprisingly simple. This includes planting milkweed, a food source for Monarch butterflies, or just letting your lawn grow, allowing for more plants and habitats insects.""Insects would just appreciate it if we just let things go a bit. You don't have to rake your yard of leaves every time. You can let the grass grow a little bit,"" said Milman.Written by Philip Drost.

CBC;Our Parenting Philosophy is a Fine Balance of Religion and Science;Being Catholic has always been important to me.My father was raised Catholic and he took it upon himself to take us to church every week. We went to Sunday school, and received sacraments.For me, it was something that provided guidelines for what’s right and wrong. Religion made me accountable, and I found comfort in it. And I knew, when I got married and had a family, I wanted it to be in a Catholic setting.My husband, also baptized Catholic, rarely attended church growing up.This mother grew up not wanting anything to do with religion. Now she wants her child to experience it, so he has the choice. Read that here.It wasn’t really a part of his life.When we decided to get married, I told him how important it was to me that we got married in a Catholic church by a priest.This required attending a “Catholic wedding prep” class and meeting with our priest a few times before the big day.My husband did it for me, but wasn’t all that thrilled about the class thing.Our priest was a former professor of mine, but he was also extremely progressive and understood my husband’s reservations. This combination helped to ensure everything turned out wonderfully.When our son was born, we had him baptized in a Catholic church (coincidentally, by the same priest who had baptized my husband as a baby), and I started bringing my son to church every Sunday.Occasionally my hubby would join us, but I was the one who would typically get our son up early and convince him to put on his fancier clothes. Armed with a bag of Cheerios and a few quiet toys, we’d head to the church. I’d sign him up for the Christmas pageant every year to be a shepherd, and by three-years-old he could recite all of the words to “Our Father.”I also answered most of his thoughtful questions about God, Jesus, hell and why we say we’re “eating the body of Christ.”Then there is the other side of the coin.Here's a list of books for non-believing parents who want to engage in conversations about religion with their kids. Check it out here.I am also tasked with dealing with the complaints or whines about even having to go to church. Which, honestly, I understand — I can remember finding church boring sometimes as a kid, too.And while my husband may not come to church often, we agreed that he would back me on bringing our son to church. So, he helped me explain to our son why church on Sundays is important: “God gives us so much in our week that we can give him on hour.”It’s a good balance, given that my husband is a science guy who wants to see it to believe it.When our son asks how the world got started, my hubby explains the big bang theory, and when he asks where the big bang came from, I usually pipe in that I think it’s the work of God.We each use science and religion to answer a lot of our son’s questions. And one thing I’ve always told my son is that this is something I believe in, and not everyone does. There are many other religions that have different views and ideas behind these questions (such as, “what is heaven”) and I want him to be aware of that.In fact, based on our discussions about different religions, my now eight-year-old has come up with his own version of the afterlife that combines Catholic and reincarnation ideals!While I believe religion is important and comforting, my husband and I also agreed that after our son receives first communion next year, we will then leave it up to him to decide whether he continues working toward receiving future sacraments.By his communion, I feel as though he’ll have a solid Catholic foundation and understand the basic principles of my religion, and from there he can decide if those ideals are something he believes in, too.Some families are atheist. This father explains why he has chosen to raise his daughter in that tradition. Read it here.I’ve found the religion that works for me, but I’ve always felt he can choose another religion down the road if he wants to — I’m fine with whatever he chooses.I take him to church now because I want him to see how religion can play a part in someone’s life. Whatever that religion may be. If it gives him solace and comfort, then I’m all for it.It isn’t always easy combining religion with science. It makes answering questions like “What happens when we die?” tricky to answer. But one thing we’ve realized is: kids are smart enough to come up with their own beliefs, especially when they have other views that are presented in such a way that they’re comprehensible.Because my husband and I have different beliefs, we think we’ve created a critical thinker who will seek out all the possible answers to his many questions about life. And, in the end, that can be a very valuable life lesson.;When we decided to get married, I told him how important it was to me that we got married in a Catholic church by a priest.We each use science and religion to answer a lot of our son’s questions.I’ve found the religion that works for me, but I’ve always felt he can choose another religion down the road if he wants to — I’m fine with whatever he chooses.I take him to church now because I want him to see how religion can play a part in someone’s life.It isn’t always easy combining religion with science.;['parenting', 'questions', 'priest', 'balance', 'important', 'son', 'science', 'religion', 'catholic', 'husband', 'fine', 'wants', 'church', 'philosophy'];0.10461658841940534;positive
CBC;Loblaws bringing Frito-Lay chips back to shelves, ending months-long pricing dispute;"Loblaws will start restocking Frito-Lay products on Monday, ending a months-long absence due to a pricing dispute between the companies, CBC News has confirmed.Frito-Lay — the PepsiCo-owned maker of snack brands such as Cheetos, Doritos, Lays, Ruffles and Sunchips — set off an unexpected food fight in February when it abruptly cut off one of Canada's biggest grocery chains because of its refusal to raise prices.The company said in February it took the extraordinary step because it is facing ""unprecedented pressures from rising costs of items, including ingredients, packaging and transportation."" It was pushing Loblaws to charge customers more for their products in order to recoup those higher costs, Frito-Lay said.But Loblaws refused to pass on those costs, with the grocery chain saying it is ""laser focused"" on keeping prices as low as possible.The Financial Post was first to report of a deal between Loblaws and PepsiCo.When contacted by CBC News, a Loblaws spokesperson gave no details about any deal but said ""we're happy to once again have a wide assortment in our chip aisle.""""All along, this was about providing value to our customers,"" the spokesperson said in an email to CBC News on Saturday.The Loblaws spokesperson added that stores were expected to be fully stocked with Frito-Lay products before the upcoming Easter weekend.";"Loblaws will start restocking Frito-Lay products on Monday, ending a months-long absence due to a pricing dispute between the companies, CBC News has confirmed.It was pushing Loblaws to charge customers more for their products in order to recoup those higher costs, Frito-Lay said.The Financial Post was first to report of a deal between Loblaws and PepsiCo.""All along, this was about providing value to our customers,"" the spokesperson said in an email to CBC News on Saturday.The Loblaws spokesperson added that stores were expected to be fully stocked with Frito-Lay products before the upcoming Easter weekend.";['loblaws', 'fritolay', 'products', 'shelves', 'chips', 'monthslong', 'bringing', 'costs', 'deal', 'grocery', 'ending', 'dispute', 'customers', 'wide', 'pricing', 'cbc', 'spokesperson'];0.15805555555555553;positive

CBC;Indigenous-led conservation program saves caribou herd from extinction;"An innovative caribou conservation program led by two First Nations communities has brought one of Canada's many dwindling caribou herds back from the brink of extinction.""It was an all out effort. We didn't go into it half-hearted,"" said Chief Roland Willson, of the West Moberly First Nation. ""I'm extremely proud of what we're doing. But at the same time, I'm mad that we're the only ones doing it.""The program is a collaboration between the West Moberly and Saulteau First Nations, in partnership with the University of British Columbia and the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. It involved a holistic approach to conservation, combining Indigenous knowledge and Western science to almost triple the size of a local caribou herd, called the Klinse-Za herd, in less than a decade.A caribou is released into the mountains of Northern B.C. (Clayton Lamb/Wildlife Infometrics Inc.)""There hasn't been a lot of good caribou news in quite a while,"" said Clayton Lamb, a wildlife biologist from University of British Columbia who was part of the research. ""One of the big takeaways from this work is that caribou conservation is possible.""The research was published recently in the journal Ecological Applications.From thousands of animals to nearly extinctCaribou play a significant role in Indigenous culture, not only as a source of food, but also as a part of traditional medicine.""The bones on caribou were used as fleshing tools [for cleaning hides],"" said Willson. ""The hides were used, like every aspect of the caribou was utilized.""Caribou excel at surviving in undisturbed old growth forest. But human activity, like oil and gas exploration and logging, have fragmented their herds from thousands of animals into smaller residential herds, which compromised their reproduction and made them more vulnerable to predators.""Our elders had noticed a decline in the populations, and they had decided to pass an internal law that we wouldn't harvest caribou until the populations started to increase, which never happened. They kept going lower and lower,"" said Willson, who added that at 55 years old, he has never been able to hunt a caribou.Caribou eating grasses and lichen in Northern B.C. (Line Giguere/Wildlife Infometrics Inc)Many of the fragmented herds in Canada are now considered functionally extinct. Between the 1990s and 2013 the Klinse-Za caribou herd shrank from approximately 250 animals to just 38, and research suggested the herd would disappear completely within 10 to 15 years without intervention.Recovery plans for the most part have been ineffective.""We sat with [scientists] and said, 'well, what can we do? What do we do? Like, what can be done? What has been done?' And we found out really quickly, nobody's actually doing anything on these things,"" said Willson.""It was actually our elders that said to us, the caribou were there for us when we needed them, and they need us now. So we need to step up and be there for them and try and help.""Protecting calves for the best chance at survivalThe conservation program started with several meetings in Saulteau First Nation in 2012.""We organized workshops with local governments, local First Nations, industry, even federal and B.C. governments. We invited everybody to the table here at Saulteau,"" said Naomi Owens-Beek, the Treaty Rights and environmental protection manager for Saulteau First Nation.The group came up with three action items: predator management, habitat restoration and maternal pens.A researcher is seen in a helicopter, preparing to catch caribou using a net gun. The caribou were then taken to a pen to be kept safe from predators. (Wildlife Infometrics Inc.)""It all makes sense because you're restoring the habitat for them to live in, you're reducing the predators so they don't get killed. And you're protecting the calves when they're in the maternal pen because they're pretty vulnerable when they're small,"" said Owens-Beek.The province took charge of the wolf culling program, and the First Nations took charge of the maternal pens, with the help of scientists from the University of British Columbia.Every winter, the scientists captured pregnant females from a helicopter using a net gun. Then, they brought the animals back to the maternal pens, which are fenced-in areas designed to keep the caribou in, and predators out.""It's not like they're in this random pasture,"" said Owens-Beek. ""It's a wild enclosure which they're familiar with.""A researcher holds a pregnant caribou on the back of a snowmobile, as they travel into a maternal pen. The fencing that keeps predators out of the pen can be seen on the right. (Wildlife Infometrics Inc.)Specially-trained Indigenous Guardians watched over the caribou from a distance for the next several months, making sure the enclosure was secure, supplementing the animals food, and only intervening if they saw an animal was sick.""I think every year we're fortunate that we're able to release more than what we bring in. And I don't think we'll ever take it for granted, that's something special,"" said Willson.The program, now in its ninth year, has seen a total of 65 calves raised in the maternal pens. This has allowed the herd's population to grow 12 per cent each year, going from 38 animals to 114. And the group has no plans to stop anytime soon.""It's not something that we want to be doing, but if we want caribou, I think it's something that we have to do,"" said Willson.A caribou feeds from a trough inside the maternal pen near Moberly Lake, B.C. (Clayton Lamb/Wildlife Infometrics Inc)And the work continues in other ways. In 2020, the First Nations worked with provincial and federal governments to secure nearly 8,000 square kilometres of habitat protection, making up more than 85 per cent of the Klinse-Za herd's territory, to ensure that the landscape can sustain caribou on its own.A second study looked at the effects of only wolf reduction on caribou populations compared to areas with both wolf reduction and maternal penning, and found that reducing the number of predators only allowed caribou populations to stop declining. But in areas where maternal pens were used in collaboration with predator reduction, herd sizes grew significantly.'Braiding' Western science and Indigenous knowledgeLamb hopes that this project can be an inspiration to scientists looking to collaborate with Indigenous communities.""The braiding of knowledge systems is something that science is working fairly hard to do, or at least there's a lot of talk about it. But it's unclear how to do it in practice,"" said Lamb.""I think that this example was really a strong case of where Western scientists and Indigenous peoples came together and were able to co-produce a piece of science that really speaks to both of our strong suits, and is really richer as a result.""Willson agrees that collaboration was one of the keys to the program's success.""I think the strength of this is that the First Nations, the local government, the provincial government and the federal government, were working together on this…. It's not a finely tuned machine yet. But, you know, we listen and we learn from each other and we're able to talk and bounce ideas off of each other and try things out.""Produced and written by Amanda Buckiewicz.";"An innovative caribou conservation program led by two First Nations communities has brought one of Canada's many dwindling caribou herds back from the brink of extinction.It involved a holistic approach to conservation, combining Indigenous knowledge and Western science to almost triple the size of a local caribou herd, called the Klinse-Za herd, in less than a decade.""One of the big takeaways from this work is that caribou conservation is possible.""Protecting calves for the best chance at survivalThe conservation program started with several meetings in Saulteau First Nation in 2012.And you're protecting the calves when they're in the maternal pen because they're pretty vulnerable when they're small,"" said Owens-Beek.";['extinction', 'conservation', 'indigenousled', 'nations', 'think', 'maternal', 'saves', 'herd', 'theyre', 'scientists', 'animals', 'herds', 'caribou', 'indigenous', 'program'];0.12196014769544178;positive
CBC;New tax credit for carbon capture will only delay climate action, warns environmental advocate;"The federal government's new carbon capture tax credit will delay Canada's progress on climate action, extending our production of fossil fuels, says an environmental advocate.""It's good news for the fossil fuel lobbyists whose activities are fuelling the climate catastrophe,"" Julia Levin, senior climate and energy program manager at the non-profit group Environmental Defence, told What On Earth host Laura Lynch.As part of its 2022 budget revealed on Thursday, the government has promised up to $10 billion and counting to support carbon capture projects — including proposals from the oil and gas industry — with climate-specific spending totalling $9.1 billion.The investment tax credit would reimburse carbon capture projects that grab pollution at the source to prevent new emissions by up to 50 per cent. Successful projects that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing existing pollution, would be reimbursed up to 60 per cent.Currently, most of the captured carbon dioxide in Canada is used in a decades-old process called enhanced oil recovery, where CO2 is pushed into an oil or gas reservoir to scrub out more fossil fuels. While that process is excluded from the credit, fossil fuel companies are still eligible to apply.While Levin says she's pleased enhanced oil recovery is ""off the table,"" she notes it would be hard to enforce how captured carbon dioxide is used in the future.Michael Bernstein is the executive director of Clean Prosperity. The group's website describes it as 'a Canadian non-profit that works toward market-based solutions to the climate crisis.' (Clean Prosperity)For Michael Bernstein, executive director of non-profit group Clean Prosperity, the move to include the oil and gas sector makes sense.""If the oil and gas sector has projects that will reduce those greenhouse gas emissions and the government believes that those are sensible investments, I don't see why we would exclude those,"" he said.In January, 400 academics signed a letter to Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland urging the exclusion of the oil and gas sector from the credit. In March, Environmental Defence published a report outlining concerns about the use of the tax credit to extend the life of oil and gas production in Canada.Levin doesn't oppose fossil fuel companies building carbon capture to reduce the emissions-intensity of oil and gas production. But she says the responsibility to pay for that should be up to industry.She also argued the federal government could put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry, then allow companies to figure out how to meet those limits.""Taxpayers' … dollars should not be on the line to subsidize the most profitable sector in the country and one that's fuelling the climate crisis,"" she said.Julia Levin is senior climate and energy program manager at the non-profit group Environmental Defence. (Submitted by Julia Levin)Bernstein sees the financial reward of the investment tax credit as a way for Canada to continue its production of fossil fuels for now. He cautions that all approved projects need to meet their promises of capturing or removing carbon dioxide.However, the details on how the government will monitor or enforce that are ""a bit thin,"" he said.Our track record is, time and time again, letting oil and gas companies off the hook. - Julia Levin, Environmental Defence""I can tell you from talking to officials within the finance department that they are committed to actually clawing back money … to take the money that they've invested in these projects away from the companies if they don't fulfil the promises they've made,"" said Bernstein.For Levin, Canada's track record of holding oil and gas companies accountable on environmental rules doesn't give her confidence it will be any different with carbon capture.""Our track record is, time and time again, letting oil and gas companies off the hook,"" she said.Against the backdrop of the latest United Nations climate report and a stark warning from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres calling ""new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness,"" Levin hoped for more investment in renewable energy.According to a report by Environmental Defence, between 2018 and 2020 the federal government spent 14 times more money on financing the fossil fuel sector than it did on renewables like wind and solar.""That ratio's not okay,"" said Levin.WATCH | Liberals promise lower deficits as billions earmarked for housing, climate changeLiberals promise lower deficits as billions earmarked for housing, climate change Duration 2:31 Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s second federal budget came with a promise of more fiscal restraint, acknowledging the government’s ability to spend is ‘not infinite.’ In the budget, billions of dollars have been allocated to tackle housing affordability and climate change. 2:31The latest budget lumps all climate spending together  including money for retrofits, grid electrification, zero-emissions vehicles, agriculture initiatives and more. Within that spending, $600 million is allocated to ""smart renewables and electrification,"" and another $2.2 billion toward the ""low carbon economy fund"" which includes the development of renewable energy.""It does concern me to some degree,"" said Bernstein of the discrepancy between climate spending and carbon capture spending.""There is a lot more money that is going to be needed for many other technologies, whether that's wind or solar or hydrogen electric vehicles,"" said Bernstein.The investment tax credit is ""a step in the right direction"" for what he thinks could be an industry dedicated to ""carbon management,"" he said.Other industries are poised to benefit from the investment tax credit, including cement, steel and chemical production — all processes which produce greenhouse gasses. New projects designed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will also be eligible. According to Levin, all of these initiatives already have funding available from the federal government.""This tax credit is about a giant new subsidy to oil and gas companies.

CBC;Harrowing journey aboard medical train in Ukraine takes injured to safer areas;"As a retrofitted medical train pulled out of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, carrying nine badly injured patients to a safer location last week, Canadian American physician Dr. Daniel Schnorr could finally exhale.""After all the patients were on board, we were getting ready to leave and we did have an air raid … so the train was stuck for a little while,"" said Schnorr, who led the first mission of its kind for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders.""But then, eventually, the air raid was lifted, and the train started moving, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief — and you're on your way. And once the train starts moving, it feels like you're already halfway there,"" he told White Coat, Black Art host Dr. Brian Goldman.Schnorr is among a number of Canadian health-care workers going to great lengths to care for Ukrainians on and near the front lines of the war that started when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.""The idea of the medical train kind of arose because we noted that the trains have, remarkably, been able to run throughout the war from the beginning,"" he said.After a security analysis, the group concluded that the trains are the safest mode of travel right now, despite the fact that the station the group departed from was bombed a few weeks earlier.Medics Nataliia Kyniv, left, and Dmitry Mogilnitski, prepare supplies ahead of the first patients coming aboard. (Médecins Sans Frontières)On March 31, the train departed with the group of patients — all suffering from blast injuries, and ranging in age from three to 84 — from Zaporizhzhia, in the country's southeastern region, and transported them about 1,000 kilometres west to the relative safety of Lviv.Making room for more injured""When we first entered into the country, MSF was kind of fanning out, trying to figure out where we could have the most effect, where we could help the most people, where we could alleviate stress on the medical system,"" said Schnorr, who runs a small emergency department in eastern Arizona when he's not dispatched to a crisis zone. This was Schnorr's fifth mission with MSF.The city of Zaporizhzhia has been receiving people who have fled Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks. As a result, hospitals there have many patients with grievous injuries that will require prolonged hospital stays, said Schnorr.""They were anxious to try to move patients out of their hospitals because they're anticipating a lot more patients coming in the next few days to weeks.""WATCH | Dr. Dan Schnorr explains the medical train evacuation:Dr. Dan Schnorr, <a href=""https://twitter.com/MSF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@MSF</a> Emergency Room Doctor, explains from onboard the train about the first medical train evacuation MSF has done in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Ukraine</a> <a href=""https://t.co/23fcI2axbl"">pic.twitter.com/23fcI2axbl</a> —@MSF_UkraineThe railway staff modified the railcars so there's space for patients to lay down, as well as for things like oxygen concentrators, IVs and other medical equipment, said Schnorr. Parts just inside the entryway to the train were cut away to make room to manoeuvre stretchers so the sickest patients could remain lying down while transferred from ambulances.""We don't have the ability to take ventilated patients, or patients that are on medications to support your blood pressure. But we can take most other patients,"" he said.Though the train will be able to take many more patients at a time in future journeys, for its inaugural medical evacuation, Schnorr said they selected a small number of patients who would need to be in a hospital for a long time, but were stable enough to survive a train ride that could be up to 24 hours, given checkpoints along the way.On board were ""nine patients, plus family members and caregivers and two cats,"" he said.A shirt with the MSF logo is seen through the window of the first medical train to transport severely injured patients to hospitals in cities further away from intense areas of conflict. (MSF)Dr. Joanne Liu, a pediatric emergency medicine physician from Montreal, was also on the ground with MSF to help assess the patients in the days and hours ahead of departure.""We talked with the parents to ask if they wanted medical evacuation or not,"" said Liu in a blog post she wrote for the MSF website . ""The first mother said, 'I want my child to be medevaced because I think it is the only chance for my child to keep his legs.' And the child looked at us and said, 'I want to walk again.'""'I just wanted to do the right thing'Canadian nurse Laura Orsatti, of Peterborough, Ont., is working at a children's hospital in Kyiv. She travelled to Ukraine on March 9 and stayed for about a month, and is now on her second stint in the capital after a four-day trip home to see her family.""I didn't want to be part of an NGO. I didn't want to be politically affiliated. I just wanted to do the right thing. So I decided to show up at the biggest children's hospital because I had that experience.""Nurse Laura Orsatti speaks to CBC News from Kyiv on March 17. (CBC)Orsatti said she's seen a range of injuries stemming from the conflict, including one child with a bullet wound who'd witnessed his father being killed on the street, a one-month-old with shrapnel wounds, patients who have been buried under rubble and a child under 10 who had been raped in front of their mother.She also said she's been moved by the strength of the Ukrainians she's working alongside. ""They want to provide the best care possible, and they're doing everything they can to save as many lives. It takes a lot of bravery. A lot of them … they don't get to go home to see their families, their houses are blown up. And they have to live here full time.""Hospitals have been frequent targets for the Russian forces .Orsatti said her hospital in Kyiv has been shot at. Here, a bullet hole can be seen through the hospital's window. (Submitted by Laura Orsatti)""You hear the sirens going off all the time. I hear the Russians flying above us,"" said Orsatti. The window of a room she was staying in at the hospital was shot at, she said.Dr. Richard Hareychuk, a third-generation Ukrainian Canadian and optometrist in Oakville, Ont., has been active in the efforts of the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada to support their homeland since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. He said he recommends that medical professionals who want to help on the ground in Ukraine do so through official channels.Global Affairs Canada has advised Canadians to avoid all travel to Ukraine and the Canadian Embassy in Ukraine has suspended its operations amid the conflict.A news release on the Ukrainian Health Ministry's website , translated to English, said that as of March 3, it had received inquiries from more than 500 doctors, nurses and paramedics from countries around the world, including Canada. Interested parties can register by filling out a questionnaire , it said, and hospital co-ordinators will help arrange deployment to the areas and facilities that most need help at a particular time.That help is certainly needed, said Hareychuk.MSF physician Dr. Daniel Schnorr, left, is pictured with Dr. Nataliiya Maidan and a Ukrainian rail staff member known only to MSF as Yurey. (Submitted by Daniel Schnorr)""There may be a little bit of a question of, well, 'Why a medic? Why not more soldiers?' The fact of the matter is a properly trained medic in the field that knows how to stop someone from excessive blood loss can save lives.""Nurses shortageAt the children's hospital in Kyiv, Orsatti said she's noticed there are more doctors than nurses.Schnorr said he's noticed the same thing. When putting together a team for MSF's medical train, he was unable to recruit any local nurses.""I think there was a shortage of nurses before the war even started, like there is in a lot of parts of the world,"" he said. But Schnorr said he also suspects that some nurses may have left their places of work to move their children to safety.His crew instead had one nurse from Belgium and a number of Ukrainian medical students working as nurses' aides.Part of the MSF medical team gets ready for patients, selected because their injuries are serious enough to warrant long hospital stays but their conditions stable enough to survive an up to 24-hour train ride. (Médecins Sans Frontières)Asked if he has sensed that he's personally in danger during the mission, Schnorr said he had some trepidation as the group entered the country.""When our team went to Kyiv in the beginning of my assignment here, the front lines were not really stable,"" he said. Still, MSF has a really good security team, in which he places a lot of faith.""I'm very conservative [about] safety when it comes to these things because I have two young daughters. So I felt comfortable that we had a plan in place to be able to make a contribution in a safe manner,"" said Schnorr.""As time goes on, you become a little bit comfortable — and maybe that can be dangerous. You don't want to become too comfortable.""On Wednesday, the MSF medical train evacuated patients from the Kramatorsk station in Eastern Ukraine. On Friday, the same station was hit with at least one Russian missile, killing dozens, Ukrainian authorities said.Orsatti said she knows she could lose her life in Ukraine.""I'm not scared to die. I'm scared my life won't mean anything  like, I haven't done anything that's worthwhile,"" she said. ""I don't know if I believe in God or anything like that.

CBC;Falling in love or falling for fraud: The dark side of online dating;"Last year, thousands of people found themselves on the wrong side of an investment scam. But they weren't duped by a crooked financial advisor or a neighbour's pyramid scheme — they were fooled, for love.In 2020 and 2021, there were 3,474 cases of romance scams in Canada, and victims were defrauded of more than $93 million dollars, according to the Canadian Anti-fraud Centre .""Technology has been this great tool that we have invented as human beings that has allowed us to be connected with each other. But technology, one thing that I've seen in my research, creates this false perception of reality,"" Carlo Handy Charles, a researcher at McMaster University, told Spark host Nora Young.""Behind my phone, I can tell you whatever I want.""Carlo Handy Charles has written about organized crime and cryptocurrency romance scams on dating platforms. (Stacey Gabitous/McMaster)Charles wrote about a new romance scam that has defrauded thousands of Canadians out of millions of dollars. The so-called 'pig-butchering' cryptocurrency scam , originating in China, has since made its way into North American online dating spaces.Charles, who's been tracking the increase of financial fraud via dating apps, said the scam is run by criminal syndicates who use professional scripts and emotional manipulation to deceive users.While traditional romance scams usually involve a direct request for money, according to Charles, ""They do that after a certain time of trying to build your trust or trying to show you that the love is real.""""The difference with the cryptocurrency [scam] is that most of these scammers, they do not tell you that they need money. Instead, they tell you that because we're a couple now, we are going to invest together for our future.""The scam involves a four-step process, where tailored profiles and 'love bombing' are used to get the victim to invest their money on a fake cryptocurrency platform.""They use social engineering, they use algorithms, to find you and then to use your own information on social media to basically manipulate you,"" Charles said.Crime and communityWhile the majority of the known victims of these crimes have been women in their 30s or early 40s, according to Charles, that data only reflects those who actually report the crime.""I'm sure there are a lot of men who have been a victim of this too, but then they don't report the crime,"" he said.The dangers of dating apps aren't limited to the virtual world.""We've seen instances where cyberstalking, or cyberharassment has actually moved, or transitioned into the physical space and [become] real-world stalking, we've seen physical violence as well,"" said Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar, an associate professor in the department of computer and information technology at Purdue University.Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar's research suggests dating app developers can do a lot more to make platforms safer for users. (Purdue)In 2021, Seigfried-Spellar co-wrote a paper looking at popular dating apps like Grindr, Tinder and Bumble, and the physical and psychological risks involved in using them.While there are valid concerns around connecting with unvetted profiles online, Seigfried-Spellar said these services can also serve an important role. ""These applications like Grindr have really allowed the LGBTQ+ community to have a space and to hold space, especially when they may not feel accepted within the physical world,"" she said.""I've chatted with individuals who felt like this was the first time that they could be their authentic self, because maybe in the physical world, they weren't out. But online, they were a part of this active community, and they finally felt accepted.""She said the prevalence of harmful behaviour on dating apps is hard to quantify. ""What we tend to see is that an instance might occur, but you might say, 'Wow, this is something that needs to be reported.' But that same instance might happen to somebody else, and they don't report it.""Dating apps and the lawRecently, Tinder announced it was partnering with a platform called Garbo to allow users to run background checks on their matches — putting the responsibility of screening in the hands of their users.Seigfried-Spellar said while this new feature may feel like a move towards greater security, there are also a lot of nuances to background checks that are not being considered.""It makes a lot of assumptions. Even though [the platforms] have said, 'we're not going to focus on drug crimes,' for instance, or traffic violations, which we know disproportionately [affect] certain people, we're instead going to focus on sexual violence and partner violence.""We also know that a lot of individuals don't report these crimes. So just because somebody comes back and their background check is clear, that doesn't mean they haven't committed an offence,"" she said.Last month, a U.S. court ruled that Match Group Inc. was not guilty of defrauding its customers for failing to keep fake profiles off of Match.com.The ruling raises questions about what legal accountability will look like for dating apps when users engage in harmful behaviour — especially in the U.S., where Match.com, and other dating apps are based.Irina Manta's upcoming book, Strangers on the Internet, is about dating apps and the law. (Carlos Farini)""So far, the courts have made it fairly clear that dating apps and dating sites have very little to no legal responsibility for the behaviour of their users, whether in the virtual world or out in the quote, unquote real world,"" said Irina Manta , a professor of law and the founding director of the Center for Intellectual Property Law at the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University.Manta has written about dating app deception and the law in the past, and is now writing a book on dating apps and the law, called Strangers on the Internet. When it comes to improving safety standards, dating apps are wary of ""becoming overly involved with safety,"" said Manta.""They might at some point perhaps start having legal obligations that they don't currently have. And they really don't want that, in part because it's expensive, and because it has the potential for PR scandals.""Sharing stories, lessening stigmaSeigfried-Spellar said there is power in testimonials. With tales of dating app deception depicted in pop culture, like the viral Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler, the stigma around falling for scams and other forms of abuse could lessen.""Maybe the willingness of other people to step up and say, 'this happened to me, and these are some of the signs that I wish I would have considered,' or 'this is what I wish I would have done, but just know that you're not alone', [will help]"" she said.""Because [if] you are able to report it, maybe it's going to keep somebody else [from] becoming the victim of either a similar situation, or they're going to start sharing those stories. That's the best thing that we can do.""Written by McKenna Hadley-Burke.

CBC;Does a Canadian millionaire's private flight to the space station mark a new era in space travel?;"Canadian businessman Mark Pathy will be part of the crew of the first fully private mission to the International Space Station (ISS). This marks another milestone in the privatization of space.The flight, called Axiom Mission 1 , will bring four passengers to the ISS where they will spend nine days conducting an assortment of experiments.The mission is being operated by a company called Axiom Space, though the ride is being provided by SpaceX, with a Dragon crew capsule atop their Falcon 9 booster. Previous private space tourist trips to the ISS had involved Russian Soyuz vehicles.Both the capsule and booster have been in space before, as SpaceX continues to demonstrate the reusability of their technology which has lowered the cost of spaceflight dramatically.A SpaceX Falcon rocket and Crew Dragon capsule will carry the Axiom mission astronauts to the International Space Station. (Axiom Spacae/SpaceX)Once on orbit, Pathy will conduct several experiments in association with the Montreal Children's Hospital, six Canadian universities and the Canadian Geographic Society.He will study sleep deprivation, chronic pain and visual impairment associated with spaceflight, and test a new technology called holoportation, which uses virtual reality for communication. Pathy and a colleague at mission control on the ground will us VR headsets to share their experiences through telepresence. He will also be participating in surveys of Earth from space.Axiom Space has big plans for the future, including what could be the first privately owned space station. Beginning in 2024, they hope to launch a series of four modules that will be attached to the ISS. Plans include two hubs with docking ports where other modules can be attached, a laboratory, and a power and life support module.An illustration of Axiom Space's planned modules which will attach to the International Space Station, then remain in orbit when the ISS is retired and de-orbited. (Axiom Space)The long-term objective is that when the ISS comes to the end of its working life, sometime around 2030, Axiom's modules will separate and remain in space. The ISS will be driven into the atmosphere where it will burn up over the South Pacific ocean. Axiom's modules will then form the core of a new, privately run, orbital outpost.To the moon?On the company's website, Axiom CEO Michael Suffredini referred to Axiom Mission 1 as ""kicking off this civilizational leap,"" adding that it's the ""true beginning of making space's potential for meaningful discovery available to private citizens and organizations for the first time.""It's not exactly likely to be available to most private citizens or organizations, though. Mark Pathy and his fellow passengers are reportedly paying $55 million US ($69.2 million Cdn) for their tickets.But it's hard to argue that this isn't a significant moment of transition from state-sponsored space flight to private enterprise – a transition partly facilitated by cost.As the Axiom mission prepares to launch, a symbol of the old model sits on a nearby launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center. NASA's new rocket, the Space Launch System or SLS is the most powerful ever built.This infographic shows the NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) compared to Saturn V that took astronauts to the moon, as well as to the space shuttle. (NASA)This massive machine is at the heart of NASA's Artemis program to return to the moon. But it is also years behind schedule and over budget. Each launch is expected to cost $4.1 billion US (over $5.1 billion Cdn) and the entire rocket system, which is largely based on old space shuttle technology, is not reusable.Compare that to the roughly $152 million US ($191 million Cdn) that a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launch costs. That rocket has less than a third of the payload capacity, but you could launch 26 of them for what one SLS launch is going to cost.A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center. (Thom Baur/Reuters)And SpaceX, of course, is developing a new rocket called the Starship which could rival SLS. It too is meant to be reusable, with an eye on the Moon and Mars.The era of private spaceflight is definitely taking off and doing it in a big way.

She began her reporting career when she was a teenager, and she says it was journalism that led her to discovering and recovering her heritage, a connection that was broken when she was taken from her Cree mother at birth and adopted by a white family.In Essential Ingredients , GoldenEagle expands on the notion of moving forward as the poetry book reflects on life, struggle and spirituality.

When the kids are little, you don't realize that the day will come pretty quickly when they graduate from high school and they find their own way. They move out — and all of a sudden you're sitting in an empty house and it's just quiet and it's very strange.I decided to write down as many memories as I could, in the form of poetry.""But, when we do get together, especially during spring, summer and early fall, as often as we can, we get out by the firepit and stories always come up. Mom, do you remember when we did this? Do you remember when we did that? And they bring up all these beautiful moments in time that I almost forgot about. They were just at the back of my mind.""I had to write them down. If we don't talk about those moments — and give them the respect and honour that they deserve — we'll forget about them. I decided to write down as many memories as I could, in the form of poetry.""Important teachers""As parents of children, we are their first teachers — and we are their most important teachers. I wanted to make sure that their childhood was beautiful, filled with wonderful memories.""I was one of those [Indigenous] children scooped up in the 1960s, and I think I missed out on quite a bit as a result of that time in my life. So when I became a parent, I said to myself, I am going to do everything the exact opposite of what I was taught.As parents of children, we are their first teachers — and we are their most important teachers.""So in the springtime, when there are potholes everywhere, I will let you go out and splash and get dirty and muddy.

CBC;'The more I play, the better I feel': Pitcher Bill (Spaceman) Lee continues to thrive at 75;"To get a sense of what infamous left-handed pitcher Bill (Spaceman) Lee is up to these days, look no further than a video of him in the stands at a baseball game that went viral last month.Lee, in a Savannah Bananas uniform, descends the stairs with a beer in hand, and makes his way onto the field. After a few warm-up stretches that include a high kick, he takes to the mound and under the flash of lightning, the 75-year-old strikes out the batter.The video clearly resonated with baseball fans, both because Lee is a towering character in baseball and because he struck out a player much younger than him.75-year-old Red Sox Hall of Famer, Bill Lee, came down from the stands with a beer in hand and then proceeded to strike somebody out.

He was later named to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2008 for holding the record for the most games pitched by a left-handed player: 321 games in all.After his time in the major leagues, Lee played ball in Canada and Venezuela, wrote four books, created his own wine, and was the subject of a biopic starring Josh Duhamel.In 1988, he claimed he was running for president of the United States as a member of the satirical Rhinoceros Party, despite the fact that the party is Canadian. In 2016, he ran for governor of Vermont with the slogan: ""We're so left, we're right.""But he loves baseball most of all, with a poetic passion.""It's the harbinger of spring. It's the first robin  it's the first blade of grass,"" he said.""It's the first time you take the plow off your truck. It's the first time you can go out with your kids, and that's what baseball is. It's Persephone and, you know, leaving Hades.""How Lee joined the BananasThe Savannah Bananas are a team in the Coastal Plain League in the United States, a collegiate summer baseball league with 15 teams across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Most of the players are in their 20s.Bananas owner Jesse Cole said he grew up in Massachusetts and followed Bill Lee's career, even interviewing him while Cole was in high school.""As soon as we started getting a plan for this year's tour, my parents found his number and I gave him a call, left a voicemail,"" Cole recalled. ""He called me back and I was just telling him what we're doing, he goes, 'I'm in! I'll be there.' And I haven't even told him at the point exactly what we're doing.""Cole was talking about both how the team plays the game — fast — as well as the Bananas' unique approach to entertainment.That includes a dancing umpire, a seniors' dance team called the Banana Nanas, a breakdancing coach, a male cheerleading team called the Man-Nanas, a banana princess called Princess Potassia, the Banana Pep Band and a magician.Cole himself wears a yellow tuxedo with a ruffled shirt and a yellow top hat to the games.""It's like being with P.T. Barnum and Barnum and Bailey Circus, the greatest show on Earth,"" said Lee.While Lee still lives in Vermont, Cole says they fly him down for games every weekend, wherever the team is playing.Lee makes his debut with the Savannah Bananas while being brought on to the field in a pedicab, pedaled by one of the Man-Nanas male cheerleaders. (Submitted by the Savannah Bananas)Offering adviceWhen Lee made his debut with the team he was driven across the field in a yellow pedicab by one of the Man-Nanas wearing a Star Wars Boba Fett helmet painted yellow.While Lee is older than many of his teammates by about 50 years, that hasn't stopped him from winning them over with his stories.""He's seen it. He's been there. And he fits in very well with the guys,"" said Cole. ""He's just one of the guys in the locker room and everyone loves him.""Lee, though, likes to see himself as the team's elder who dispenses advice and wisdom.""They sit at the back of the bus and they think I'm Buddha. Who happened to be a hell raiser when he started,"" said Lee.But he doesn't think that his age holds him back at all.""The more I play, the better I feel,"" he said.Written by Andrea Bellemare.

CBC;This Ukrainian radio station is staying on air for the war effort from a makeshift studio in the mountains;"A Kyiv radio station is broadcasting from a makeshift studio to bring Ukrainians the latest news about the war, and music to lift their spirits during the hours spent sitting in air raid shelters.""In Kyiv, air raid alerts are eight to nine times a day, lasting from 30 minutes to three hours,"" said Bogdan Bolkhovetsky, CEO of Kraina FM, an independent Ukrainian music station.""And while people sit in shelters, they sing … Ukrainian songs,"" he told The Current's Matt Galloway.Playing a variety of Ukrainian on the airwaves ""is good for people … it brings back some normality to life, I guess,"" he said.Bolkhovetsky and his family fled Kyiv in the days after the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. Members of his team also fled, and they regrouped in a small village in the Carpathian Mountains on Feb. 27. The village lies south of Lviv in the west of Ukraine, where many refugees have fled to escape Russia's advance from the east. Some find refuge in the west's smaller towns and villages, but others press on to cross into neighbouring Poland or Slovakia.When they reported to the local military station to volunteer, soldiers asked if they had any fighting experience. Bolkhovetsky said no.After explaining that he and his team produced Kraina FM, he said the soldiers urged them to ""just go and keep doing the radio station.""Leaving Kyiv meant the station's normal broadcast was disrupted. Out of Kraina FM's usual 15 staff, Bolkhovetsky said only three of his team members came to this village. The rest fled to other parts of Ukraine, or crossed the border into Poland.Bolkhovetsky and his team set up shop in a local accountant's office, despite only having one microphone between them. (It was incidentally left in one staff member's car when they left Kyiv).Extra equipment was impossible to retrieve from Kyiv. But they managed to source laptops and a mixer from Austria, as part of Europe-wide efforts to send aid and supplies to Ukraine, Bolkhovetsky said.They began to record segments in their makeshift studio, and arranged to transfer the files to a network of producers across the European Union who get it online and send the signal to broadcast towers. But the village's internet connection is weak, significantly slowing down their work.I used to have a house. I used to have a cat. I used to have a car. It's destroyed. - Bogdan BolkhovetskyDespite these challenges, they're able to broadcast not just music, but news about the war, poetry and stories from their listeners, and announcements from the military. The broadcast is available online and to cities in range, across Ukraine.Recently a local military base contacted Bolkhovetsky to say they needed a printer.Within 30 minutes of announcing that on air, the military called back to say they'd already received three, dropped off by local residents, he said.""[It shows] the power of people who listen to this and react.""Military are heroes, not us: BolkhovetskyAs the weeks passed, Bolkhovetsky sent his family across the border to safety, but stayed behind to continue broadcasting.""What we are doing right now is absolutely nothing compared to what [the] military is doing,"" he said.""Military are heroes, all the rest are just assistance at best.""WATCH | Drone footage of destruction in Borodyanka, near KyivDrone footage of destruction in Borodyanka, Ukraine Duration 0:54 Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released a video of destruction in Borodoyanka, a town near Kyiv that was formerly controlled by Russian forces but has now been recaptured by Ukraine. 0:54People have jumped at chances to help, he said, despite having lost so much.""I used to have a regular life, I don't have it anymore.""""I used to have a house.

CBC;Empathy: the life lesson of George Eliot's Middlemarch;"George Eliot's 1871-1872 novel Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life was a hit from the start.Queen Victoria loved it. The parlour of her London home had to be enlarged to fit the crowds who came to her readings. But what exactly was the appeal of a book with its scores of characters, some of whom interact with each other, while some don't — and all of whom seem to drop into the action as if from a balloon?The trick may be not in reading Middlemarch, but in re-reading it. As Vladimir Nabokov once quipped: the only way to read a book properly is to read it more than once. That's when the patterns and themes emerge like the figure in Henry James's carpet.""People do not appear haphazard in her works,"" said V. S. Pritchett of Eliot. ""They are not eccentrics. They are all planned and placed. She is orderly in her ethics  she is orderly in her social observation."" But with all due respect to Pritchett, they are eccentrics: Dorothea Brooke, the ""star"" of the novel, is naive, spirited, and flighty — and marries a fool, Mr. Casaubon, who's a blowhard and a gasbag all at once. Rosamund Vincy is precious to a fault. There are many others.They're eccentric simply by being human. But Pritchett is right about Eliot's ethics and social observation: Middlemarch is a book about finding a way to sympathize with others whom we may not like very much, or even dislike.Take Mr. Casaubon. ""A dried up old stick of a man,"" says Rebecca Mead, writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch. He's a lone scholar, working on a project he calls ""The Key to All Mythologies,"" which aims to connect the Christian narrative with the history of humankind completely, tying in psychology, cosmology, theology: in other words, it's a book about everything.Middlemarch is a book that 'seems to offer different narratives, different storylines, different moods even for different stages of life,' says writer Rebecca Mead. She adds that every time she picks up the book it offers something new. (Elisabeth C. Prochnik/Penguin Random House)But it's a failure. And in a deep pocket of his mind, Casaubon knows it, too. But he represses the knowledge. We're meant to find him a self-duping near-charlatan who takes advantage of Dorothea Brooke's enthusiasm for him and his work. Until, as Eliot warms up to her character, we're asked to look at him with fresh eyes.""For my part I am very sorry for him,"" Eliot's narrator tells us in Middlemarch. ""It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self."" In other words, can we despise Casaubon and yet feel sorry for him, too?""You are a lot more sympathetic, I think, or you should be,"" said Mead, ""to the tragedy of a person not becoming everything that they hoped that they might be. That's a terrible thing. And that's so much the theme of Middlemarch."" Nose in books, mostly all of them outdated relics, he is missing the great spectacle of life.From hate to sympathyStill, the pendulum swings back.Casaubon lashes out at Dorothea for spending too much time with his nephew, Will Ladislaw. He suspects them of planning a separate life without him once he's dead: it's paranoia (although he's not entirely wrong) and through modern eyes we also see Casaubon as a manipulator. Back and forth the reader goes, hating Casaubon, sympathizing with him.'The primary driver of [George Eliot's] characters is this kind of ambition to change the world in some way,' says Nicholas Dames. (Columbia University)That's exactly the point, says Nicholas Dames, Professor of Humanities at Columbia University in New York.""All these things have to be true. So you have to kind of be moving around constantly. And that's what the narrator does, is invite you always to be moving around your perspectives. It's part of what gives the novel its length, because you have to see so many different viewpoints on any given person at any given moment.""There are lessons on how to live in Middlemarch. Some, like Johanna-Thomas Corr in The New Statesman have referred to the book as a ""secular Bible"": we hate Casaubon, we pity Casaubon. Sound familiar?It's like the story of Job: feeling tenderness for someone in misery or distress because of some unforeseen crisis. Only for Eliot, who earlier in life rejected Christianity, it's a lesson that comes without the supernatural trappings of religion: all the angels and burning bushes and little winged babies.Continual relevanceBooks like Middlemarch have endless traction. It's what gives the novel its long-term appeal. And it's what inspires those who look to Eliot for insights into modern relationships, like Rebecca Shoptaw, who wrote and directed a web series adaptation of Middlemarch on YouTube: 60 episodes, each five or six minutes long, all set in a modern college town called Middlemarch, Connecticut.Although Mary Garth is considered 'plain' in Middlemarch, Fred Vincy is in love with her and wants to marry her. (Wikimedia)It's low-budget on purpose: meant to look like a video blog. Shoptaw casts friends, law students, students of Middle East studies, and a student whose only previous acting experience was in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, playing a wall. Shoptaw's Middlemarch: The Series goes an extra step, mixing up genders, portraying some characters like Fred Vincy as gay.""The changing of genders wasn't an attempt to fix anything,"" says Shoptaw. ""It wasn't like an intervention against [the book]. I was trying to keep alive and bring across the spirit of Middlemarch. And I wanted this to be more like, you know, when people put on Shakespeare plays, and they'll set it somewhere interesting.""Both Eliot's classic novel and the modern adaptations, including a 1994 BBC TV series, are realistic, insofar as they want to portray what it means to live with and among complicated, often difficult people. This particular kind of realism has a special resonance now. When it comes to COVID, for example, there are those who believe in a scientific narrative and those who don't, and the two sides are in conflict. There is a clash over individual versus community ""rights"", however we choose to define them.In this supercharged context, can we still have sympathy for those we don't agree with? One hundred and fifty years after publication, George Eliot's Middlemarch is still asking us that question.Guests in this episode:Nicholas Dames is the Theodore Kahan Professor of Humanities at Columbia University in New York.Rebecca Mead is a writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch.Ruth Livesey is Head of the English Department at Royal Holloway, University of London in the U.K.Ronjaunee Chatterjee is an Associate Professor of English at Concordia University in Montreal.Laura Gehrke is a Ph.D. student in the Department of English at the University of Washington.Fionnuala Dillane is at the School of English, Drama and Film at the University College of Dublin, Ireland.Rebecca Shoptaw is a writer and director of Middlemarch: The Series on Youtube.Middlemarch, The BBC Series, 1994, starring Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea Brooke, written by Andrew Davies based on the novel by George Eliot.*This episode was produced by Tom Jokinen.";"George Eliot's 1871-1872 novel Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life was a hit from the start.""A dried up old stick of a man,"" says Rebecca Mead, writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch.Middlemarch is a book that 'seems to offer different narratives, different storylines, different moods even for different stages of life,' says writer Rebecca Mead.One hundred and fifty years after publication, George Eliot's Middlemarch is still asking us that question.Rebecca Mead is a writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch.";['george', 'book', 'different', 'eliots', 'casaubon', 'series', 'life', 'middlemarch', 'writer', 'lesson', 'university', 'novel', 'empathy'];0.08498792130488561;neutral
CBC;'It was catastrophic,' relief worker says of the Ukraine train station missile strike;"At least 50 are dead, scores more wounded, and vital infrastructure is destroyed after a missile struck a train station in Kramatorsk, Ukrainian authorities say. A relief worker who witnessed the attack described it as ""complete carnage.""""It is generally known that these stations are filled with innocent people – with women, children, grandparents that are trying to leave,"" said Nate Mook, CEO of the humanitarian organization World Central Kitchen, which is helping distribute food in Kramatorsk and other affected areas in Eastern Europe.Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the station in the city of Kramatorsk was hit by a Tochka U short-range ballistic missile. The missile contained cluster munitions that explode in mid-air, spraying small lethal bomblets over a wider area. Kyrylenko said thousands of civilians trying to flee the eastern Ukrainian city were at the station at the time of what he described as a ""deliberate"" attack.Mook was near the train station when the missile hit, and told As It Happens guest host Dave Seglins about what he saw. Here is part of their conversation.Nate, can you describe for me the moment this attack took place?We drove past the railway station on an overpass… I looked down and on the platform, I saw thousands of people, as had been there previous days. And we passed the station, probably not less than two minutes later, we heard the booms, we heard the explosions. There were probably five to 10 of them in quick succession… And we didn't know what they were from or what was going on. But we headed inside, ready to go down to our underground shelter.One of the warehouse workers told us that he had actually seen one of the missiles. It was that close as it was flying by. You could see the wings on the missile, he said. And it was one of them, at least, that he saw was intercepted by Ukrainian air defence.We were then notified that two of the missiles had struck the railway station where we had been planning to head next. So we headed over there to see what the scene was, and it was catastrophic.What did you see?The extent of the damage was very spread out all across the station platform and in the front of the station. There was broken glass and debris everywhere. There was actually a missile, whether it was the remnants of one or an unexploded missile or one that had been shot down, that was sitting in grass, in the parking lot. On this missile written in paint were the words ""for the children"" in Russian.The remains of a large rocket with the words 'for the children' in Russian is pictured next to the main building of a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, which was hit by a missile, killing at least 50 people. (Fadel Senna/AFP via Getty Images)And there were cars that had just been put out, they had been on fire. There were people that were still in those cars as they burned. There were many bodies that had been collected from all across the railway platform. This is an area where we had been standing the day before.The evacuation trains are prioritized for women and children, mothers and their kids, and also seniors and those with disabilities. The last couple of days, we've seen many people in wheelchairs. We've seen seniors being helped onto the trains by the amazing heroic railway workers. And there's a seating area on the platform. They had a tent there as well, where seniors could sit as they were leaving. And this is the area that was hit. And so it was just complete carnage on the platform. And we saw dozens of casualties ourselves and many people were being taken away in ambulances and on stretchers to the local hospitals by the time that we had arrived.You've been on the ground in Ukraine for some time. What was it like to be in the midst of an attack like this one?I've got to admit, it was shocking because these railway stations have been a lifeline for innocent civilians to be getting out of the cities as they are coming under attack.It is generally known that these stations are filled with innocent people … trying to leave. And so I think while there was certainly a sense that an attack was looming in Kramatorsk overall, because it has been said that this is going to be an area of focus now that Russian troops are regrouping and moving out of the north around Kyiv. I think there was sort of this idea that the train station in this area would not be a direct target.Now, of course, we're starting to see the brutality of these attacks in this invasion and what is being done, and we've seen what's happened in places like Mariupol… But to experience, to see it, to realize there is no strategic value in striking a train station like this, with thousands of people evacuating... It is just murder, straight out.And so, you know, I think there's a sense of shock and just complete, you know, speechlessness of what happened today, of the brutality and the inhumanity of it all. And yet there is this determination by the Ukrainian people to fight and to do what they can to make sure that their people stay safe.There's no way to to describe it other than it is intentional murder of civilians to traumatize, to terrorize, to really just create havoc and carnage. - Nate Mook, World Central Kitchen CEOHow do you make sense of the fact that these innocent civilians are being targeted?I've been thinking about this a lot since I first got to Ukraine … seeing firsthand the impact, meeting the individuals, hearing the accounts of their stories. You sort of think at some point, something is going to make sense, you must be able to kind of reconcile what's going on — and you really can't.We were in a residential community in Kharkiv just a few days ago, delivering meals, when a shell hit not too far from us. And this is purely residential. There is nothing else there but apartment buildings where innocent people were living. There's no way to to describe it other than it is intentional murder of civilians to traumatize, to terrorize, to really just create havoc and carnage.We weren’t far from the Kramatorsk train station when missiles hit, picking up flour from a <a href=""https://twitter.com/WCKitchen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WCKitchen</a> warehouse to bring to a bakery. Others can share images, but I can tell you innocent women & children were murdered here today. Our local team continues to work to get food out. <a href=""https://t.co/JLu8cxu0He"">pic.twitter.com/JLu8cxu0He</a> —@natemookThese people have been told to flee eastern regions. You've described them as being desperate to do so. A train station has now been hit. How is that going to affect people's ability to get out?This is a great question and one that I think nobody really knows the full answer to. The railways were a lifeline…. Kramatorsk has been relatively peaceful in the past weeks, compared to some other cities in the east and certainly around Kyiv. And so it is not clear that passenger service will return on the trains here. This may be the end of train service to Kramatorsk, and that means that people will have to take buses out of the city by road.People here who are still in this city don't have vehicles. There's not a lot of cars in the streets… The mayor estimates there are still 80,000 to 90,000 people that are still in this city. However, many of them are either stuck in their homes or they're walking. People that had vehicles, that had the ability to leave, have already done so.Our job here was to support those that are stuck here, making sure they have the food supplies that they need, so we don't end up with a situation like Mariupol, where people are literally starving to death. And also to support these families as they're going on this long journey out of Kramatorsk. Our local team here that we are supporting and that lives here is determined to continue. And so we're going to do whatever we can to support them while keeping our team as safe as possible.Written by Olsy Sorokina with files from CBC News.

CBC;We need to invest in health maintenance over treatment of disease, argues scientist;"In 2020, physician and scientist Sir Mark Walport won the annual Henry G. Friesen International Prize in Health Research. He was scheduled to deliver the annual lecture then, but COVID put a stop to that.While his lecture was delayed, the innovator says he discovered new insights arising from the pandemic.""Science has become part of everyday public discourse in the most extraordinary ways,"" he said. ""The idea that people are sort of looking at the reproduction number of the virus and working [out] whether it's going up or down — and understanding exponential growth.""The internationally-acclaimed researcher is known globally for his innovative work in health research, and was the U.K.'s Chief Scientific Adviser from 2013 to 2017 and Chief Executive of U.K. Research and Innovation from 2017 to 2020.In 2021, he was finally able to deliver the annual Henry G. Friesen lecture in Health Research at Massey College, University of Toronto. It is called Medical Research and Innovation: Post-Pandemic Priorities.Sir Walport spoke to IDEAS host Nahlah Ayed. Here is an excerpt from their conversation.NA: Do you think the world was prepared for COVID?MW: No, I mean, the world wasn't prepared for COVID, and at some level each pandemic will be of a new virus, something that it may be a variant of the virus we've seen before, or it might be a completely novel virus.And in that sense, we'll never be prepared in the details because we won't know what the virus is, or indeed any other infectious agent until it actually starts infections. What we do need to do — and we are in a position actually in the coronavirus pandemic — is that we can discover things about infectious disease at a pace that was inconceivable even five or 10 years ago.Perhaps what might have been surprising is that there have been winners and losers broadly dividing the rich from the poor. And that has had a racial and geographic aspect to it. Did you expect that?Well, I think that shouldn't have come as a surprise because disease does attack people in very unequal fashions. And so it doesn't matter whether it's chronic noninfectious disease, cardiovascular disease or diabetes or infectious diseases. We know that the poor, the malnourished, the elderly people who are weak for any cause are much more susceptible.Vancouver resident Aviva Martin says she feels like seniors are the 'ignored generation' as restrictions lift, but risk of suffering from serious illness from COVID-19 remains high for the elderly. (Ben Nelms/CBC)But I think it was a surprise to many people the extent to which this new coronavirus did have such unequal impacts.If there's one lesson that comes out of this for every country around the world, that is that we haven't invested enough in public health in actually preventing things from happening.But if we knew that there would be this disparity, where did the gap occur, do you think?Different viruses, of course, do behave in different ways.So the 1918 flu pandemic, which was the last great pandemic to hit human populations, which killed more people than died in the First World War. Interestingly, that virus was more lethal for younger people  whereas of course, it turns out that the new coronavirus is much more lethal for the elderly. And so there are always some differences that you can't completely prepare for.But we essentially know that people's health — and it doesn't matter whether it's poorer populations in U.K. or minority populations around the world — they are more susceptible to chronic diseases, and there are all sorts of factors for that. It's partly that they are less healthy, potentially have more diabetes, more hypertension, more obesity.Mask-wearers in Mill Valley, California, 1918. (Raymond Coyne/Lucretia Little History Room, Mill Valley Public Library/Public domain)It may be that they seek health care a bit later. They have less access to health care. They have the sorts of jobs that mean that they can't shelter themselves from infectious diseases more easily. They're never exactly the same for two different diseases, but it tells us that we need to be ever-vigilant and we probably need to spend more money on the maintenance of health rather than the treatment of disease.You say when you refer to this pandemic that there are no grounds for triumphalism. What are you thinking about when you say that we shouldn't feel triumphant?I think that science has contributed a lot and there's been a temptation to say, 'Well, we've discovered all these drugs, we've discovered all these vaccines. And, you know, somehow we've got on top of it.' There was a feeling in the 1950s that with the discovery of antibiotics, that infectious diseases weren't going to be a problem anymore, and that turned out to be about as wrong as it's possible to imagine.So I think we mustn't somehow feel that science came to the rescue and we don't need to worry about future pandemics. We do.When it comes to health care policy and research, you talk about the imbalance between focus on disease and focus on health. It seems intuitive to say that if we spend resources making sure people stay healthy rather than primarily intervening when they get sick, that in the long term we'll be better off. Why don't we act accordingly?Well, I think it comes back to the sort of primary drivers of policy in governments around the world. And so the levers that are needed to maintain health are actually almost all levers that sit outside departments of health, which are mis-named. They should be departments of disease.Healthy aging starts pre-birth. Actually, it starts in maternal education and maternal health, and then it starts in education from the earliest point. So what happens to you when you're 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 is going to affect how you age 50, 60 years later. It depends on housing. It depends on transport policy. It depends on clean air. And so being a healthy human, it's all the other aspects of our life: how we live, who we live with.But if you are a housing department, then your primary concern is 'let's get as many houses built as we possibly can.' And there's probably too little attention paid, as it were, to public health decisions when it comes to education, to transport, to work policies. And that's the challenge. It's arguably the responsibility of government. The premier responsibility is the health, the well-being, the resilience and security of the population — and for governments to focus on that, they're in a potential position to make lots of good policies. But all of this comes at a price.What is, do you think in your mind, the most significant challenge to scientific discovery today?The need for it is enormous. I said in my talk that necessity is the mother of invention, but we need invention in order to tackle so many problems. So I think a lot of the challenge is capacity, to actually persuading people, in education, in school, about the power of research and discovery, persuading policy makers that it really matters, that they can make better decisions if they have the best evidence.So I think the opportunity is really limited by this sort of capacity in the amount of funds available to do it. But boy, do we need it if we're going to tackle some of the huge challenges that we face.Does it feel as though those challenges are bigger and different than those that came that face scientists before?Yes, because the population of the planet is so much greater. It's the famous sort of hockey stick curve that people have talked about. But if you look at human population, almost everything is growing exponentially and the challenges with it.One of the paradoxes of it is the young people on the planet who will face the most serious problems in the next 50, 70, 90 years. But they have in general, less of a political voice than the older.And particularly in Europe and North America. In Japan, we've got increasingly elderly populations, and it's the danger that the old vote against the interests of the young.Friesen Prize Lecture | Medical Research and Innovation: Post-Pandemic Priorities*Q&A was edited for clairty and length.

CBC;Kamal Al-Solaylee explores the meaning of home to immigrants — including where he wants to be buried;"Story originally published on Dec. 20, 2021. Audio originally broadcast Sept. 14, 2021.Read Story TranscriptImmigration stories are complex, but their broad motivations often focus on leaving one's homeland to escape corruption, conflict or poverty, then finding a new home in a new country.But according to author Kamal Al-Solaylee, an immigrant's journey isn't complete until they return to the homeland they tried leaving behind.""I think every immigrant story has return as part of it,"" he told The Current 's Matt Galloway.I would say that as long as there's been immigration or exile, there's been return. It is sort of baked into the very movement of people across continents and countries. -Kamal Al-SolayleeIt's the central theme of his latest book, Return: Why We Go Back to Where We Come From. In it, he explores what it means — for immigrants, in particular — to call somewhere home.Shortly after leaving his native Yemen due to British decolonization, Al-Solaylee found refuge in Lebanon and then Egypt. He soon made his way to England to complete his PhD, before moving to Canada in 1996.Al-Solaylee spoke to Galloway in September about the desire among some immigrants like himself to return to their motherlands — and how graves are the ""ultimate expression"" of where one belongs.Here's part of their conversation.The book starts with this question that not a lot of us, to be honest, are grappling with before we have to. The question is: Where do you want to be buried? Why did you want to start this book there?In his newest book, Kamal Al-Solaylee explores what it means – for immigrants, in particular – to call somewhere home. (HarperCollins)I couldn't think of anything that says, ""This is home, this is the soil, this is the land that I belong to"" … [than] if you choose to be buried in your homeland.It seemed to me to connect this inexplicable desire with, literally, the land that you are connected to.As I mentioned in the book, it was a question that took me by surprise, because it was my partner at the time who asked me that question as we were walking down Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Midtown Toronto. And it's interesting. The question is almost nine years old now, and has lingered ever since.Why do you think that is?I think for me, the one question that sort of underwrites all of my books and my writing is this idea of ""Where do I belong? Where is home?"" And the question has lingered because it forced me to confront that.Yes, I've moved to Toronto, and yes, I've moved to Canada, and I've had — and I'm still having — a wonderful life.… But there's a part of me that doesn't feel completely connected to it, and there's a part of me that still thinks that the land of my ancestors is where I should spend, probably, the end of my life and where I should probably be buried.When you spoke with people broadly, what did you learn about why it is that people want to go back to where they came from?If I were to put it down to one observation, I would say that as long as there's been immigration or exile, there's been return. It is sort of baked into the very movement of people across continents and countries.The only reason this may not be talked about enough is that sometimes return is very hard to quantify or to analyze, because the countries don't necessarily keep data about who's returned to their homeland. And return itself can be multidirectional. People go to their homeland and then can come back to their adopted country and then go back.So return as a phenomenon is much harder to study [and] to analyze than, say, immigration, which those countries tend to keep records.It is the most organic, the most natural human desire [to return]. - Al-SolayleeTell me more about that. Why is it that, as you say in the book, liberals in particular, think of immigration as unidirectional? When we speak about migration, why don't we talk about return?I think there is perhaps a misconception that return implies defeat, or at least that the host country has failed in its duty of care towards newcomers.The countries that have large numbers of immigrants have always cast themselves as the kind of safe haven for migrants and refugees and exiles. And when some of these people decide that, ""You know what? This is not working. I'm going back to where I come from"" … in my opinion, some of the people who are sort of talking about immigration or planning immigration policies tend to see that as a kind of a slap in the face or an insult to the host country, when it shouldn't be.It is the most organic, the most natural human desire [to return]. And some people will immigrate, will have great success, will always have a piece of, say, Canada as part of their lives, but can still also choose to go back to their country of origin.At the end of this book, you say that you're longing to return, the desire to return is an obsession. This is a grim question to ask, but have you figured out where you want to be buried?I would like to be buried in Aden, [Yemen], to be perfectly honest. I'd like to be buried very close to my grandparents. I'd like to end my days in Aden.And that's where you believe you belong?I think belonging is very complex, but if I have to choose, I would choose to go back to my roots.WATCH: How these Ontarians are rediscovering their culture and rootsThese Ontarians are rediscovering their culture and sharing their journey Duration 3:40 CBC Toronto is launching a new series called Rediscovering Culture, which takes a look at how people in the GTA are reconnecting with — and learning about — their cultural identity and familial roots. In our first installment, we introduce you to two women doing just that: Tiara Jade Chutkhan and Roveena Chand Jassal. 3:40I think that's an answer that would probably not go down very well with many, many listeners. It doesn't even sit well with my friends when I mention it.Why do you think this wouldn't go down well, as you say, with listeners or your friends?I think I go back to that point where the arc of an immigrant success story has some predictable elements to it, and one of them is sort of loyalty and love for [the] adopted homeland, which I do have…. And yet, any duality in that belonging is seen as less than gratefulness for the host country.I'm always amazed at how many of my friends refer to me or refer to other people in our circle as, you know, success stories … and I'm so grateful to Canada for all of that.But I also want to propose that I could have that and also… don't begrudge me the right to also want to go back to the roots, to go back to the motherland.Written by Mouhamad Rachini.

CBC;I created a gift registry to celebrate my future as a child-free woman;"This is a First Person column by artist and photographer Jackie Dives who has chosen to not have children. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see the FAQ.When people get married or have a baby, they can set up a gift registry for themselves.It's a way for people to help them celebrate and to help them move into the next phase of their life. But what if marriage and kids aren't something you want for yourself?I know I don't want to have children. As I enter my late 30s, I've become more confident sharing my goals and desires, which don't align with what women have traditionally done in the past. But I'm starting to think about why only some lifestyles are celebrated. Similar to those who choose marriage or pregnancy, I want to shout from the rooftops about my choices because I'm proud and excited about them. So, to celebrate the road less travelled, I set up a gift registry for myself.'Are you sure?'When my partner of five years left so that he could have children — something I've always known I don't want — it really did feel like I was choosing myself.But that decision wasn't celebrated. People asked, ""are you sure?""Some women told me how brave they thought I was, and even said they weren't sure they would have been able to walk away from the relationship out of fear of the unknown of being child free.Jackie Dives photographs herself with her cat. (Jackie Dives)Of course, many women have not had children in the past, but this decision has rarely been seen as something to celebrate loudly or to praise and encourage. It has been thought of as something that couldn't possibly have been chosen, but must have been the result of unfortunate circumstances.When my partner and I separated over our differences about having kids, I was left with no idea of what my future could look like. This has been a weird and challenging phase of life — a struggle to figure out how to move forward.I knew I didn't want a life of parenting, but there is little representation in media of women who don't want to have kids.I grew up in an unstable household full of emotional and physical violence and I think that has made me less confident choosing the road less travelled.Making art to help me move forwardMaking art about my experience is how I make sense of the world.This child-free gift registry is going to be part of a larger body of work that I am creating to help me move forward — to celebrate who I am, where I am going, and the choices I've made.The registry contains items I can use while travelling alone, books by women who have chosen to not have children, art supplies, and a few household items like an air fryer and milk frother.Some of the items on Jackie Dives' gift registry. (Jackie Dives)I'm photographing the registry items along with the personalized notes that people have sent me.I have been astounded by the response so far. I have received gifts and notes from some of the closest people in my life and also from complete strangers. The gifts are fun and amazing, of course, but the notes that come with them are the real gifts.From one childfree lady to another, one photographer to another, one childhood trauma survivor to another  enjoy your childfree life and the adventures you take and the art you make. Can't wait to see the results! From DeeI'm encouraged that I'm not the only one who thinks it's important to loudly and publicly celebrate women for more than getting married and having babies.Jackie Dives is an artist in Vancouver who created a ""road less traveled"" gift registry as part of an ongoing art project.

CBC;They met in a Nazi labour camp. They were reunited 79 years later at a memorial gala;"Jack Waksal was attending a Holocaust memorial gala in South Florida when he noticed a man who looked familiar.He couldn't quite place him at first. Then the man, Sam Ron, got up on stage to deliver a speech and spoke of his time in the Nazi labour camp in Pionki, Poland.That's when a light bulb went off in Waksal's head. Not only did he know Ron, but the pair worked together nearly 80 years ago, shovelling coal in Pionki so their Nazi captors could make munitions for the war.When Ron's speech was over, Waksal went over to his old friend's table and told him who he was.""He got up and I kissed him, you know, and I said, 'It's so good that somebody else survived from my camp,'"" Waksal, 97, told As It Happens guest host Dave Seglins. ""Then he grabbed me. You know, we kissed each other. That's how he reacted. It was unbelievable.""Ron, 97, was guest of honour at the March 20 gala, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He was being recognized for a lifetime of educating people about the horrors of the Holocaust. His wife, children and grandchildren were all at his side when Waksal came running over.""He jumped out of the seat, ran over to me and hugged me and said, 'Oh, you're my brother, my brother!'"" Ron said. ""It was amazing.""Life in a Nazi labour campWhen the two reunited in the ballroom, they were happy, dressed to the nines and celebrating with their families. It was a far cry from the last time they'd seen each other.Waksal and Ron — then known as Shmuel Rakowski — were both taken from their Polish towns by the Nazis and ended up at the Pionki munitions camp in 1943, at the peak of the Second World War.The two teenagers worked in the same location every day for a year, shovelling coal for hours and hours with no reprieve. It was strenuous, dirty work, and Waksal says their Nazi captors didn't seem to think of them as human.""Terrible is not the word,"" Waksal said. ""Sometimes it was 24 hours [of working].""The pair barely had time to eat and sleep, let alone get to know each other. They spoke very little. Nevertheless, both described their relationship as incredibly close — a kind of unspoken bond, forged in hardship.""I was with him all the time, together,"" Waksal said.A portrait of Shmuel Rakowski — now known as Sam Ron — that his mother kept hidden in her shoe during her imprisonment in the Nazi labour and concentration camps. (Holocaust Memorial Museum )They say finding each other again after these years, when there are so few Holocaust survivors left, was nothing short of a miracle.""I had so many people, others that I met, you know, even in the same camp — but they're all gone, all gone by now,"" Ron said.Ron lost his brother in the Holocaust. Waksal lost both parents, two sisters and a brother — making him the lone survivor in his family.""There's a lot of hard memories,"" Waksal said. ""I got a lot of friends from my own city [who were] working together [in the labour camps]. They did not survive. They never came back.""The Pionki camp was dismantled in 1944, and its prisoners were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Oranienburg, Germany.Before he could be shipped away, Waksal decided to make a run for it, escaping his captors and hiding in the forest with other escaped Jews.Ron, meanwhile, was taken to Sachenhausen. In 1945, the Nazis sent him on a three-week death march. It was on that journey that he was liberated by American troops.Ron, left, and Waksal say they plan to keep in touch. (Jacqueline Marie Photography)The two men's lives followed a surprisingly similar path after the war. Both eventually got married, had families and settled in Ohio — Ron in Canton and Waksal in Dayton. Both later retired in Florida — Ron in Boca Raton and Waksal in Bal Harbour.And most importantly, both became Holocaust educators, traveling to schools and events to speak about what happened to them.It's work they remain passionate about.""It should never happen again in life to people,"" Waksal said of the Holocaust. ""Anyone in the world should never go through this life what the Jewish people went through in the Second World War.""Ron says their message is more important than ever, especially with so few Holocaust survivors left to share their stories.""For 40 years I'm talking, hoping for peace, for security. So far, it didn't happen yet. You know, the world gets worse every year. And we still keep talking about it,"" Ron said.""I hope that the newer generation does better than the rest, that we'll have some peace, hope, and eliminate evil in this world.""Written by Sheena Goodyear.

CBC;How Middlemarch helps us confront reality, 150 years on;"Virginia Woolf called it ""one of the few English novels written for grownup people.""George Eliot's Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life was published serially in 1871 and 1872. And 150 years later, it's still one of the most read — and re-read — English novels of all time.As A.S. Byatt once observed, it's a book from which writers learn how novels work: how ""to invent a world peopled by a large number of interrelated people, almost all of whose processes of thought, developments of consciousness, biological anxieties, sense of their past and future can most scrupulously be made available to readers, can work with and against each other, can lead to failure, or partial failure, or triumphant growth.""Setting up a marriage for failureGrowth and failure: George Eliot shies away from neither.Just as in life, her characters are at the mercy of circumstance and their own, often terrible, decisions. It's only a small spoiler (but how do you spoil such a beloved 150-year-old book?) to say that there's no happy ending — not really — in Middlemarch.Jane Austen's books often end with a wedding or, in the case of Pride and Prejudice, two weddings. But as Rebecca Mead, writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch told IDEAS, ""what George Eliot does, is she gives us a bad marriage from the very beginning of the book.""The marriage is between young Dorothea Brooke and the much older (as in, over 40!) Edward Casaubon. Dorothea lives with her uncle in the English town of Middlemarch (a fictional stand-in for the West Midlands town of Coventry, where the author grew up) and her sister Celia  the girls have lost their parents and their uncle is now their guardian.Dorothea Brooke with Will Ladislaw from George Eliot’s Middlemarch. Ladislaw is Edward Casaubon's younger disinherited cousin. (Wikimedia)Mr. Casaubon is a vicar and a scholar who has been working, endlessly and without much progress, on an academic study of the biblical roots of the human story which he calls ""The Key To All Mythologies."" Dorothea, who wants to better herself and the lives of the peasants in the village, expects that such knowledge and scholarship will raise all boats, and accepts Casaubon's surprise marriage proposal in the hopes that she can help him complete his important project.But it is not an important project.""This book [The Key To All Mythologies] is dead in the water,"" said Nicholas Dames, Theodore Kahan Professor of Humanities at Columbia University in New York. ""And he's aware of it just enough, to want to repress that knowledge. But when he's looking for a wife, he's looking for someone who's going to naively think that this project is the greatest thing ever, and protect him a little bit from the knowledge that actually this thing is already a failure.""What follows, for some 800 pages, is the story of how that marriage, and the hopeless project that brought them together, falls apart — and how Dorothea learns to live with her naive choices.A Victorian soap operaBut what also follows are the stories of the other men and women in Middlemarch who emerge in Dorothea's orbit: the young doctor Lydgate, who, like Dorothea, has ambitious plans to set the world on its proper axis through reform of a near-medieval medical system  but who, again like Dorothea, embarks on a doomed marriage with the social climber Rosamund Vincy, daughter of the mayor of Middlemarch. Rosamund wants out of town altogether.There's the story of Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, an evangelist and a true believer who has ideas of making Middlemarch a more Christian-fearing community.Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a newly arrived doctor to Middlemarch marries Rosamond Vincy, a woman who spends his money and leads him into debt. (Wikimedia)But a dark character from his past, Mr. Raffles, pops up in the latter chapters to bully Bulstrode and threaten to reveal the truth behind his ill-gotten success, which if known would destroy his good name and position in town.There's the story of Mr. Casaubon's nephew, Will Ladislaw, an artist and a more likely love match for Dorothea who pines after her… for 60 chapters.There's the story of Fred Vincy, Rosamund's brother, and his inability not to lose wads of money on get-rich-quick schemes, often involving dubious horse trading. He loves Mary Garth. Mary might love him. But he needs to grow up if she's ever to admit it.On first blush (or first read), it all adds up to a Victorian soap opera. But George Eliot is after a bigger quarry.""George Eliot grew up a Christian,"" said Mead. ""But she lost her faith later in her life, when she really came to analyze and think hard intellectually about what was being demanded of her, to believe the miracles of Christianity.""For Eliot, who was born Mary Anne Evans but concocted a male pen-name to aid her in the commercial side of the publishing business, there are moral lessons in religion that can inform a life, but any attempt to explain life through the received Christian story would be as fruitless as explaining it with Mr. Casaubon's Key to All Mythologies.Instead, according to Ruth Livesey, Head of the English Department at Royal Holloway, University of London in the U.K., the ""philosophical thinking that underlie[s] Middlemarch was shaped by [Eliot's] decades reviewing the latest works, reading Darwin exploring natural history and the sciences, reading the emergent science of psychology as well as philosophy, all things that are threaded through Middlemarch.""At the age of 31, Mary Anne Evans leaves small town England for London where she meets Herbert Spencer, Ralph Waldo Emerson and her future common-law husband, the journalist George Henry Lewes (whose first name she'll wind up borrowing).""And, you know,"" said Nicholas Dames, ""I think that's always such a fascinating thing, to me, the willpower it must have taken not just to break away from a particular kind of community, but to break away as a young woman, with at that point no means of independent subsistence, and knowing full well, that [her] problems were not actually in the long run going to be solvable.""In many ways, her own experience, with insoluble problems and promises unfulfilled, will inform the stories of Dorothea Brooke, Dr. Lydgate and Will Ladislaw, and all the characters of Middlemarch, her masterpiece to come.Guests in this episode:Nicholas Dames is the Theodore Kahan Professor of Humanities at Columbia University in New York.Rebecca Mead is a writer for The New Yorker and author of My Life in Middlemarch.Ruth Livesey is Head of the English Department at Royal Holloway, University of London in the U.K.Ronjaunee Chatterjee is an Associate Professor of English at Concordia University in Montreal.Laura Gehrke is a Ph.D. student in the Department of English at the University of Washington.Fionnuala Dillane is at the School of English, Drama and Film at the University College of Dublin, Ireland.Rebecca Shoptaw is a writer and director of Middlemarch: The Series on Youtube.Middlemarch, The BBC Series, 1994, starring Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea Brooke, written by Andrew Davies based on the novel by George Eliot.*This episode was produced by Tom Jokinen.";"George Eliot's Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life was published serially in 1871 and 1872.Setting up a marriage for failureGrowth and failure: George Eliot shies away from neither.But George Eliot is after a bigger quarry.""George Eliot grew up a Christian,"" said Mead.Middlemarch, The BBC Series, 1994, starring Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea Brooke, written by Andrew Davies based on the novel by George Eliot.";['150', 'george', 'mr', 'dorothea', 'marriage', 'confront', 'english', 'life', 'middlemarch', 'eliot', 'town', 'university', 'helps', 'reality'];0.07919613868274582;neutral
CBC;CBC News | Information about COVID-19 in Canada;LISTENWhat we might learn from people who don't get COVIDThe number of cases of COVID-19 is climbing again.

CBC;Can owning a dog be a 'selfish' pursuit? This academic thinks so;"Digging into the stories of dogs in American literature led Molly Labenski to realize a disconnect in our relationship to canines.""I think over the last few decades we've developed a bit more of an entitlement when it comes to our relationship with dogs,"" said Labenski, who is finishing her PhD in English at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.Her deep dive into classics like Old Yeller — the story of a devoted dog who saves his human family on numerous occasions but gets a bullet in his head after contracting rabies — reveals a pattern in literature where dogs are discarded once their usefulness to humans subsides.She says this attitude reflects our real-world relationship to dogs and other animals, arguing that people want them in their lives as ""accessories"" that can easily be discarded.Author and professor emerita Josephine Donovan argues animals have a standpoint on the way they're treated. She adds that humans should pay attention to that standpoint when deciding how to treat animals. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)Labenski points to the high demand for so-called designer dog breeds, while thousands of dogs in shelters need good homes, as a clear example of that.These designer dogs include mixed breeds such as goldendoodles (half golden retriever and half poodle) and cockapoos (Cocker spaniel/poodle), which are favoured because they don't shed as much, or pomskies (husky/Pomeranian), which are convenient for people who want smaller dogs.""It's at the point where we've got designer dogs customized so they can come in any colour, any pattern, any size,"" said Labenski. ""The word 'design' is perfect — you can design a dog in a way that really reduces them to more of a commodity than it does a companion.""According to statistics from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Canadian Humane Society , in 2019 nearly 400,000 shelter dogs were euthanized across North America.""If we really love dogs, we would be trying to help ones that already exist rather than creating ones for our weirdly specific needs,"" said Labenski, who adopted an Australian shepherd shelter dog during the pandemic.""I think pet-keeping has become largely a selfish pursuit,"" she said. ""We get dogs specifically for personal reasons that don't really benefit the dogs, whether it's to assuage our own loneliness or if you want to get more exercise, then getting a dog is the way to make that happen. Couples often get dogs to sort of test the waters before they have children.""High demand for dogsPets of all kinds have been in high demand during the pandemic. According to research by conducted by Abacus Data , about 900,000 more Canadians became new pet owners during the pandemic. (This data was collected through an online survey of 1,500 Canadian adults between June 4 and 9, 2021.)Some animal shelters have noted an increase in pets being given up.""It's been insane the number of surrenders we get — it's tripled in the time I've worked here,"" said Cassandra Ferrante, who for the past six years has been working as a dog trainer at Dog Tales, a private animal shelter and rescue near King City, north of Toronto.""We get at least five to 10 [surrender] applications a day. We can't even keep up with the surrender requests.""Cassandra Ferrante is one of roughly 50 employees caring for dogs at Dog Tales, a rescue shelter that sits on a 20-hectare farm north of Toronto. She’s pictured here with Goji, who has since been successfully adopted. (Submitted by Cassandra Ferrante )Every year, Dog Tales is able to find adoptive homes for about 350 surrendered and rescued dogs. But for Ferrante, who now manages the kennel, dealing with the surrender requests is difficult.""It's the least favourite part of my job, I would say, because I can't relate to people who are surrendering their dogs… I can't understand how someone can just dispose of their dog, no matter how hard it is, if you're moving or whatever.""What we can learn about dogs in literatureFor her PhD work, Labenski combed through canonical works of American fiction in which dogs are discarded, killed or left for dead. She's identified troubling dog scenes in classics such as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye.The working title of Labenski's thesis is ""Who Let the Dogs Die?: Domestic Animal Abuse in American Fiction.""""For me, the dog characters in literature are just as important as the human ones,"" said Labenski. ""We think we have this great relationship with animals, but the reality of the fiction shows us otherwise…. The dog is really often ignored as an individual in itself in literature.""Labenski draws on a framework known as animal standpoint theory, which aspires to analyze the literature from the animals' perspective.Author and professor emerita Josephine Donovan argues animals have a vantage point that humans need to respect, both in the real world and in literature. (Carl Court/Getty Images)One of the founding figures of this theory is Josephine Donovan, professor emerita in the department of English at the University of Maine and the author of The Aesthetics of Care: On the Literary Treatment of Animals.""[Animals are] considered commodities,"" said Donovan. ""And under the law, they're considered property. And in science, they're considered objects for laboratory experimentation. And so to the extent that literature comes to stabilize the objectification of animals, that's what animal standpoint criticism is [discouraging].""Condemning violence against animals in literature is one thing, but Donovan goes further, arguing that animals should not be used in fiction without regard to their own point of view.""Animals should not just be used as literary devices,"" said Donovan. ""So often, they're just used as symbols or metaphors, or in some way to comment on the state of mind of the human character, and the animal herself is discarded and then basically ignored.""Donovan, whose forthcoming book is called Animals, Mind and Matter, would like to see literature that would ""give the animals more voice.""""My overall goal is to break through this objectification and change the whole cultural notion so that we see animals as living subjects who have points of view, who have minds, who have feelings, who have thoughts, who have inner worlds, needs and wishes.""Animals 'rich as metaphors'While intrigued by certain aspects of animal standpoint theory, fellow author and dog lover Richard Teleky isn't convinced.""I'm genuinely puzzled about [Donovan's] attitude towards the imagination,"" said Teleky, editor of an anthology called The Exile Book of Canadian Dog Stories.""If you are too judgmental about the way writers in the past have used animals, you do a disservice both to the writer and to the past … you're going to wipe out much of Western literature.""Booker-prize winning author Yann Martel also finds the animal-vantage-point approach restrictive.""The usefulness of animals for me is precisely that they're very rich as metaphors,"" said Martel, whose novels Life of Pi and Beatrice and Virgil rely on animal characters to tell the story.Yann Martel — probably best known for his Booker Prize-winning novel Life of Pi — relies heavily on animal characters in all of his books, which serve in highly symbolic or metaphorical roles. (Geoff Howe/Vintage Canada)""We tend to be very cynical about our own species. We tend not to be cynical about animals, especially wild animals. We imbue animals with a sense of wonder, of marvel, and that's very useful for a storyteller, because then I can take an animal character and right away get beyond your natural cynicism.""As for the violence toward animals in the novels Labenski is studying, Martel argues it can inspire empathy, adding that writing stories strictly from an animal vantage limits the imagination.""Stories are only useful for us. Animals don't have stories,"" said Martel, pointing out, for example, that telling the story of a slug from the slug's point of view serves no purpose for that creature. ""And it'll be quite dull for us, because a slug has a very limited intellect.""Labenski remains committed to advocating for animals — even fictional ones.""There'll always be a bit of a discrepancy between the opinions of literary critics and authors,"" she said. ""I would say [to authors] to consider animals more fully than they are right now. It is easy to make animals ornamental in literature, because they are rather ornamental in our lives already.""Guests in this episode (in order of appearance):Molly Labenski is a Queen's University PhD student in the English department.

CBC;Here's why thousands of Etsy sellers are boycotting the platform;"When Tricia Robinson first got on Etsy in 2013, it was to help save her cat's life.""My cat got really ill and I was getting vet bills through the roof and I couldn't afford to pay them,"" Robinson said. ""So I created an illustration that was inspired by him and I sold it.""That's when Robinson realized she could use the platform to sell more of her work and actually make a living off of it.But after receiving her first payment from Etsy, the Montreal artist says she was struck by the difference between her sales and the amount that was being deposited into her account. That's when she paid attention to all the fees Etsy charges sellers on the platform.At first, she was okay with it.Tricia Robinson has been selling her artwork on Etsy for nine years. Now, she's planning to boycotting the website over Etsy's fee increase. (CBC News)""It kind of became this thing of like, okay, well, I'm making money as an artist. I have access to this online marketplace. It's pretty cool for the most part,"" she said.Etsy was founded in 2005, offering an online marketplace for artists and craftspeople to sell handmade and vintage items as well as craft supplies. The website has attracted millions of buyers and sellers and provided a platform for artists to become entrepreneurs.But over the years, Robinson says she started to see her margins shrink as Etsy's grew. A policy introduced in 2019 incentivized sellers to offer free shipping for purchases over $35 US by promising to optimize those shops to U.S. buyers. Robinson first refused to opt in, but eventually caved as she saw her U.S. sales disappear.Offering free shipping was taking off at least half her profit margin, she said. That's when things started to go downhill on the platform for Robinson.""[Etsy] was this really great marketplace that did celebrate handmade and local small business,"" said Robinson. ""But they're not like that anymore.""Now, Robinson is one of thousands of sellers who have said they plan to boycott the site from April 11 to 18 after the site announced it would be hiking its transaction fees from five to 6.5 per cent.Fee hike sparks petitionThis comes after Etsy's strong fourth quarter earnings, which beat expectations.The announcement led Kristi Cassidy, a seamstress from Westerly, Rhode Island, to start a petition after posting on Reddit calling for an Etsy sellers' union. Cassidy told CBC News more than 17,000 sellers joined the boycott as of Monday morning.""The post was basically asking when does this end because it's just getting worse and worse and I don't think it's going to end unless we do something,"" she said.The petition also lists other demands, including letting sellers opt out of off-site advertising, which generates sales that Etsy charges sellers more for.Cassidy says she stopped offering custom orders through Etsy because she could be charged as much as $100 for a dress sale that comes from an off-site ad.In a statement, an Etsy spokesperson said the increase in fee will help boost their investments in marketing, customer support, and removing listings that don't meet company policies.""Our revised fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in each of these key areas so that we can better serve our community,"" the statement reads.Tricia Robinson, an illustrator based in Montreal, used Etsy to sell her artwork. (CBC News)Company faces shareholder pressure to boost profits, says expertEtsy has historically had an open and honest relationship with its sellers, says University of British Columbia professor David Clough.However, Clough says it has become strained over the years.""Since 2018, they've raised their fees twice, which suggests they're trying to perhaps profit at the expense of their marketplace sellers,"" he said.Etsy became a publicly traded company in 2015, making it susceptible to shareholder pressure.With over five million sellers on the site and 90 million customers, Clough says raising transaction fees is a new way for the company to boost its bottom line.""As they've expanded their user base, it becomes harder to grow revenue by adding more users. So this makes them look for other sources of revenue.""Kristi Cassidy designs gothic wedding dresses and costumes that she would sell on Etsy. She started a petition calling on Etsy to cancel its planned fee increase. (Kristi Cassidy)Etsy's fees are still lower than e-commerce competitors like Amazon, which charges eight to 15 per cent in addition to other fees.Still, continuing to raise fees could risk Etsy's reputation as they deviate further from the initial values of the company that allowed small businesses to make money, he says.As for the boycott's potential effect on Etsy, Clough says it could create momentum for more dialogue between the company and sellers as a collective entity.""If they face pushback from sellers for this raise, then it makes them think twice about raising the fees down the line,"" he said.Cassidy says she hasn't been in communication with Etsy about the petition and the boycott.And while she's not counting on Etsy rolling back its fee hike, she says she's excited about building a community of sellers that want to advocate for better pay and company policies.""The things that we could do together, it feels limitless,"" she said.";"That's when she paid attention to all the fees Etsy charges sellers on the platform.Now, she's planning to boycotting the website over Etsy's fee increase.The announcement led Kristi Cassidy, a seamstress from Westerly, Rhode Island, to start a petition after posting on Reddit calling for an Etsy sellers' union.The petition also lists other demands, including letting sellers opt out of off-site advertising, which generates sales that Etsy charges sellers more for.""Since 2018, they've raised their fees twice, which suggests they're trying to perhaps profit at the expense of their marketplace sellers,"" he said.";['thousands', 'etsy', 'fee', 'sellers', 'heres', 'robinson', 'fees', 'boycotting', 'platform', 'sell', 'marketplace', 'petition', 'company', 'increase'];0.13818577936224993;positive

CBC;Be careful what you sign: Ontario man fighting for home after private mortgage gone wrong;"A Markham, Ont., man is struggling to hold on to the home where he's lived for 15 years after he signed on to a high-interest mortgage with a private lending company that is now pursuing him in court for not making payments.Mississauga-based Morex Capital initiated court proceedings earlier this year to take control of the home through power of sale, but has since changed tack after CBC News began asking questions about the situation.The company's lawyer now says it's willing to negotiate with 44-year-old Christian Brooks to reduce the amount owing on the $195,000 mortgage that has ballooned to $248,000.Brooks went to the alternative lender seeking a loan in 2019 because he thought it was his only option.The freelance graphic designer had a low credit score, bills to pay and a collections agency was after him. Tax returns show his annual income at the time was slightly more than $7,000, excluding savings.""It was my first time doing something like this,"" said Brooks. ""It was out of desperation.""I had no choice but to take it because I was already in financial debt. - Christian Brooks on signing a mortgage with Morex CapitalThis type of mortgage — funded by private investors that have pooled money to offer loans in exchange for a return on investment — has become more common in Canada. Borrowers should be aware, it's often not subject to the same kind of lending conditions as a traditional mortgage offered by a chartered bank.Mortgage carried 10.49% interest rateAn acquaintance referred him to Morex Capital, a company that invests in ""high yielding, short-term first and second residential Ontario mortgages,"" according to its website.Brooks wasn't buying the detached bungalow on Cheeseman Drive, it already belonged to his grandmother. Brooks says he was mostly raised by her and has lived alone at the home since she moved to a nursing home several years ago.He is a joint tenant on the title, meaning he would inherit the property upon his grandmother's death, and has power of attorney for her property, which he used to sign for her.In June 2019, Brooks took out a loan against the $800,000 house in the form of a one-year, $195,000 mortgage with a 10.49 per cent interest rate, according to the signed mortgage commitment reviewed by CBC News.Although he borrowed $195,000, Morex Capital provided $148,000 after fees and payouts.According to the mortgage document, the fees included a $29,000 payment to an individual who Brooks says he doesn't know, an $8,000 administration fee, a $4,000 broker fee and an annual renewal fee of up to $8,000, along with other potential charges for late payments and lawyers in case of default.Brooks willingly signed.""I agreed to it because of the situation I was in,"" he said. ""I had no choice but to take it because I was already in financial debt.""He says his goal was to build back his credit, then go to a bank and get a line of credit with a lower interest rate.Brooks says he made interest-only payments of around $1,700 via pre-authorized debit each month for two years without incident and claims Morex didn't contact him until June 2021 — two years after the initial agreement — to renew the mortgage.He signed a mortgage renewal agreement that month, which included $16,000 in renewal fees for 2020 and 2021 to be paid upfront. When Brooks couldn't pay that much all at once, he says the company allegedly stopped accepting his monthly payments in July 2021 and has refused to cash cheques he subsequently provided.Morex Capital initiated power-of-sale proceedings in January, seeking to take control of the home and kick Brooks out, according to a statement of claim filed in a Newmarket court.Morex alleges in the claim that Brooks is in default and he owes $248,950.44 — an amount that includes the mortgage principal, interest, missed payments, late fees, legal costs and a host of other fees. That's on top of the $40,800 Brooks already paid in interest.After CBC News reached out to Morex Capital, the company's lawyer disputed Brook's claims as inaccurate, but wouldn't elaborate when asked for specifics. In a subsequent statement, the lawyer said Morex would no longer be pursuing power of sale.""Regardless of the merits of the case in favour of Morex, Morex is committed to working with Mr. Brooks (and with any of its borrowers) to avoid Power of Sale proceedings and will do what they can to assist borrowers to keep their homes,"" Darryl Singer of Diamond & Diamond wrote.'Not a normal mortgage'Toronto real estate lawyers Audrey Loeb and Jonathan Miller of the firm Shibley Righton LLP have taken on Brooks's case on a pro bono basis. They say some of the mortgage's terms, how the deal came together and Brooks's interactions with Morex raise a number of questions.""This is not a normal mortgage,"" said Loeb. ""This is a mortgage used in very unusual circumstances where somebody, I believe, is being taken advantage of.""First of all, Brooks claims Morex referred him to a lawyer to provide him with independent legal representation when signing the mortgage.""When you get … independent legal advice, which is what [Brooks] needed to have as a borrower, he should have gone to a lawyer who had no connection whatsoever to Morex,"" said Loeb. ""And if you're getting referrals from Morex, my view is you have a connection.""Second, the disclosure-to-borrower form Brooks signed in early June 2019 shows the mortgage principal was originally $185,000. Brooks says it was increased to $195,000 when he went to sign the commitment at the lawyer's office on June 27, without explanation.Jonathan Miller and Audrey Loeb are partners at the Toronto real estate law firm Shibley RIghton LLP, and say the terms of Brooks's mortgage raise a number of questions. (Greg Bruce/CBC)Third, Brooks's lawyers say Morex Capital hasn't explained why the person who received $29,000 from the mortgage proceeds was entitled to that payment.Finally, Brooks's lawyers argue many of the fees Morex says Brooks owes seem excessive, including the $8,000 annual renewal fee and legal fees.""In the statement of claim, there's reference to $7,000 in legal fees and and then an additional charge of $7,500, which basically amounts to a fee for being required to tell their lawyer that their borrower is in default,"" said Miller.""All in all, there's probably thirty or forty thousand dollars in amounts that have accrued here that are, in our view, inappropriate.""Brooks and his lawyers say they are not reneging on the mortgage principal or interest, but are seeking to reduce the amount of fees owing to something more manageable, while avoiding a forced sale of the home.""I want to pay Morex off to get them off my back,"" said Brooks. ""When people pay you money, you pay them back. But let's do it in a civil way where no one gets hurt.""Alternative lending a growing industryMore Canadians have been shunning banks and credit unions and seeking mortgages from alternative lenders in recent years. At the same time, investors have poured into the industry, hoping to cash in on a real estate market where property values have skyrocketed.According to Statistics Canada, the value of non-bank mortgages increased more than 10 times between 2007 and 2018 — growing to $86.7 billion in 2018 from $8.5 billion in 2007.Most of that growth has come from mortgage finance corporations (MFCs), which are financial institutions that typically underwrite and sell insured mortgages to the Big Six banks.MFCs are subject to many of the same regulations as banks, which impose strict rules about who they can lend to based on income and credit rating.But mortgage investment corporations (MICs) like Morex Capital, which pool money from private investors to finance customized mortgages, don't have the same lending constraints. They tend to offer shorter term, interest-only loans at higher rates because they are taking on more risk by lending to riskier clients.MICs have also seen double-digit growth annually on average for the past 10 years.Statistics Canada says the total financial assets of MICs reached $32.3 billion in 2020, up from $11.4 billion in 2008.On its website, Morex Capital boasts that investors have received a 9.35 per cent annualized return on their investments since the company's inception in 2012.Ron Butler is a mortgage broker and one of the founders of Butler Mortgage. He says, in general, alternative mortgage lenders are required to ensure that the products they offer to customers are suitable to their financial situation. (CBC News)Ron Butler, a mortgage broker at Butler Mortgage and a 27-year veteran of the industry, says, in general, alternative lenders are obliged to offer a product that is suitable to clients seeking a mortgage.""You must know your client, you must understand their situation, you must understand their relative situation in the future, and you must plan a solution that is suitable to that client,"" said Butler.Borrowers also have a responsibility to know what kind of mortgage they're signing, says Butler.""They should shop around, they should call multiple people, multiple mortgage brokers … and get their own lawyer ahead of time who can give them some advice about what to do and what to look out for,"" said Butler. ""The real problem that exists today is the public has virtually no awareness of how private mortgages work.""";"Mortgage carried 10.49% interest rateAn acquaintance referred him to Morex Capital, a company that invests in ""high yielding, short-term first and second residential Ontario mortgages,"" according to its website.(Greg Bruce/CBC)Third, Brooks's lawyers say Morex Capital hasn't explained why the person who received $29,000 from the mortgage proceeds was entitled to that payment.Alternative lending a growing industryMore Canadians have been shunning banks and credit unions and seeking mortgages from alternative lenders in recent years.But mortgage investment corporations (MICs) like Morex Capital, which pool money from private investors to finance customized mortgages, don't have the same lending constraints.On its website, Morex Capital boasts that investors have received a 9.35 per cent annualized return on their investments since the company's inception in 2012.";['lawyers', 'morex', 'private', 'mortgage', 'gone', 'careful', 'wrong', 'capital', 'fees', 'lawyer', 'seeking', 'pay', 'ontario', 'fighting', 'sign', 'man', 'mortgages', 'brooks'];0.10403061224489794;positive
CBC;Please stop asking me where I got COVID;"This First Person column is written by Melinda Maldonado who is recovering from long COVID. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see the FAQ.When my dog looked at me with pleading eyes and a whine, I reluctantly grabbed her leash and made it downstairs. I knew I was too exhausted to walk Estelle long enough to tire her out but a grassy fenced area in my condo complex caught my eye on that cold February day. I looked at my dog and we agreed: to hell with it.Soon it was my dog leaping into the air and me expending zero energy in one spot in an endless loop of fetch. It was glorious until a neighbour hollered at me to get out.That's when I started oversharing with strangers: ""I had COVID and I'm really struggling with fatigue right now.""My neighbour was more interested in bylaw enforcement than sympathy, but that didn't deter me from giving it a go with others. Since then, I've had a lot of practice because three months after a breakthrough COVID infection that left me bedridden for weeks, I'm still managing debilitating fatigue.Today, everyone knows someone who has been ""omicroned"" but there is still so much stigma associated with it. Contact tracing is no longer being done, but when I got COVID, everyone wanted to know how I got it.Before blurting things out to neighbours, I self-flagellated my way through a self-audit of where I'd been. Since December, my husband and I hunkered down after a public health call spooked us with news of a possible exposure. We isolated as much as condo-dwellers can with a dog, which means frequent elevator rides.My audit results: no moral slip-ups. Shame is so 2020. I texted friends a photo of the two lines I'd achieved on a rapid antigen test: ""FML.""Melinda Maldonado holds up the rapid test showing she tested positive for COVID-19. (Melinda Maldonado)But the proof that stigma is alive is in how we talk about it. My social feeds have been full of COVID stories and most include one detail: vaccination status. It's OK to announce you had it if you're fully vaccinated. It's OK to post photos of in-person gatherings if you confirm that everyone did rapid tests. Flouting public health guidelines? Not me.I get it. Mentioning that I'm triple-vaccinated in the same breath as revealing I had COVID feels important. Obviously, go get vaccinated as vaccines can help reduce the risk of getting long COVID .But I'm telling you that getting COVID wasn't my personal failure to prevent it. I didn't throw caution to the wind, cavorting with the unmasked at raucous parties.Stigma crops up in the way people rationalize away potential cases of COVID, which have been harder to confirm since Ontario changed the rules about who qualifies for a PCR test. Cough and runny nose? Allergies, a sinus infection or as one cousin said, ""I still maintain it was a winter cold!""But that stigma has also changed my mindset to be more vocal about my needs.A few weeks ago, I had a bad day. Physical, mental or emotional exertion drains energy , and I had spent my day's rations on cognitive load at work. I was trying to stand up from sitting on the floor when my arms gave out. I looked at my husband and burst into tears. ""It's like being in prison,"" he said. ""Eventually you'll get out.""Since then I've hired a dog walker and gone on sick leave, with plans to gradually return to work when I'm ready.Melinda Maldonado, who suffers from long COVID, recovers her strength in bed beside her dog, Estelle. (Melinda Maldonado)But that's not the only thing that's changed.

CBC;Fixer says former Alberta justice minister hired him to get reporter's phone logs;"A self-described political fixer says a former Alberta justice minister hired him to obtain a reporter's phone logs.David Wallace says he was hired by Jonathan Denis to get the phone records of Alanna Smith, a former Calgary Herald reporter now of The Canadian Press. Wallace said Denis told him he wanted to trace sources Smith had drawn on for a story about whether the size of Denis's wedding reception broke COVID-19 protocols.In an email from his lawyer, Denis denied that he or his clients talked to Wallace.Wallace told The Canadian Press that Denis got his name through Alan Hallman and Gerald Chipeur, longtime conservative operatives.""Jonathan called me (and) told me that at his wedding he feels he had been targeted for poor press,"" Wallace said in an interview. ""He wanted to find out who (Smith's) sources were.""He wanted me to go into my source contacts using databases to their private cellphone information communications.""Wallace said he warned Denis that obtaining phone logs could be illegal.""He basically said this is just information I'm gathering for my own use.""Denis was a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister in Alberta from 2010 to 2015 and justice minister for the last three of those years. Recently, he has been reported to be an organizer for Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre's campaign for leadership of the federal party.Wallace said he gets politicians out of tight spots for a living.According to the political fixer, David Wallace, Jonathan Denis obtained his name through Alan Hallman, pictured, and Gerald Chipeur, both longtime conservative operatives. (CBC)""I'm a repairman,"" said Wallace, a former Ontarian now living in Calgary. ""I can find things or people and I can massage and fix difficult situations.""Wallace said he has had a 30-year career in political backrooms. He spoke with The Canadian Press because, he said, he's had enough.""I'm tired of being a tool,"" he said. ""I'm done.""Wallace said he's also grown concerned his work could be used to intimidate people or improperly influence political debate.Wallace, who is not a licensed private investigator, said he was lured to the West by the promise of lucrative contracts from people prominent in Alberta conservative circles. In early 2021, he said,he heard from Hallman.Hallman, whose association with provincial Conservative politics goes back to the 1990s, managed Jason Kenney's 2017 campaign for the leadership of the United Conservative Party until he was suspended for one year. At the time, Hallman said the suspension was related to the use of profanity in a social media post.He remains close to the premier. In 2020, he held a birthday party for Kenney attended by two cabinet ministers, said a guest who was there. His son, Chad Hallman, works as a political staffer for Alberta Health.""I got a phone call from Hallman, asking me to speak to his friend Jonathan,"" Wallace said. ""I said, 'OK.""'Dozens of emails, text messages, bank statementsWallace backs up what he says with dozens of emails, text messages, bank statements, invoices and other electronic documents. They include messages that appear to be from Denis, but Denis has not confirmed they are his.The Canadian Press has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the emails and other documents using the data accompanying them.However, some emails involve people not involved in this story. The Canadian Press contacted seven. Five confirmed they had sent the emails and two declined comment  none said the emails were false or altered.In the documents, a message that appears to come from Denis claims the Calgary Herald received a tip about his Jan. 30, 2021, wedding reception.He appears to say the tip was an attempt to embarrass UCP legislature member Mike Ellis, a guest at the reception and party whip. Ellis was then thought to be considering a run for Calgary mayor.The documents suggest Denis was trying to find the source of the tip through Smith's phone logs.""She and the Herald are not the target,"" said a Feb. 13, 2021, purported email from Denis to Wallace. ""I want to find out who's pushing this.""A separate email the same day suggests Wallace and Denis reached a deal. Denis would pay Wallace $5,000 per month based on at least 20 hours per week.""How long do you anticipate working on this before likely achieving results?"" asks an email sent the next day, seemingly from Denis.""Rest easy, it won't be a hard fix,"" Wallace appears to have responded. ""People like the ones who do such things are always sloppy and leave lots of evidence.""The emails suggest Denis hired Wallace on Feb. 15.""I am hiring you on the recommendation of Alan Hallman, who says you have got tangible results for him,"" said an email that day, apparently from Denis to Wallace.""Respectfully, I expect the same, and can send you a fair bit of more work if this investigation bears fruit. I should let you know that one of your competitors in Calgary told me there was no way he could get results here, so my chips are on you.""A Feb. 15 e-transfer receipt appears to show a payment of $5,350 from Denis to Wallace. An email sent two days later appears to show Denis promising Wallace more work ""if we can meet with some success here.""The documents provided by Wallace say the work didn't take long. By March 20, a message purportedly from Wallace reported results.""Hello, picking up the cell carrier logs from my source this afternoon,"" says an email from an account that appears to belong to Wallace. ""I'll need $1,100 to cover the rest of bill for it. If that's authorized let me know and you can e-transfer me.""The documents seem to show an $1,180 payment from Denis to Wallace was made the following week.Wallace said he falsified some of the information he gave Denis out of concern for the reporter's safety.""The records are legitimate,"" he said. ""I just didn't provide him with the legitimate phone box in terms of the actual calls, times and orders.""The emails seem to suggest Denis was initially satisfied. On April 11, one says: ""May have a new file for you (Wallace). Chat me up in the a.m.""Tone changesBut by June, a new tone creeps in.""I've been requesting backup documents in my matter now for over two months,"" says a June 23 email, purportedly from Denis.""I've paid you 'good money' for this report but it is useless to me without the backup documents. I have a lot more work I can throw you in Calgary from me personally and from my contacts. However — I need this documentation.""Denis's lawyer, Brendan Miller, said in a letter his client is unable to respond to questions raised by the emails because that would force Denis to violate solicitor-client privilege.""As Mr. Denis is committed to upholding his professional obligations, we are unable to respond,"" wrote Miller.""If there were information conveyed between Mr. Denis or his clients with Mr. Wallace (which is not admitted but denied), it would be subject to privilege.""Miller does not specify which client he is referring to. Ellis's press secretary, Eric Engler, said Ellis has not hired Denis for over a decade and was not aware of or in any way involved in efforts to obtain the reporter's phone logs.Hallman seemed to have maintained interest in Wallace's work. In an apparent March 28, 2021, WhatsApp message to Wallace, he asked if any phone numbers from previous messages ""line up with the Jonathan investigation.""The documents include a seeming non-disclosure agreement blocking Wallace from releasing communications between him and Hallman. Signed in April, it also forbids Wallace from making disparaging comments about Hallman and releases Hallman from any liability toward Wallace.In a brief telephone conversation, Hallman refused to comment on Wallace's claims, but acknowledged knowing him.""The guy's unstable,"" Hallman told The Canadian Press. ""I want nothing to do with him.""Hallman did not respond to a registered letter delivered to his office March 25 containing a list of detailed questions.Wallace's emails suggest Hallman wasn't the only conservative operative familiar with Wallace.A Jan. 17, 2021, note that appears to be from Chipeur reads: ""The client is very happy with your previous assistance,"" then goes on to offer Wallace a contract.Chipeur was a lawyer for the federal Conservative party and helped work out the merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform Party of Canada.He did not respond to a letter delivered to his office April 1.These days, Wallace said, he isn't interested in new contracts.

For two years, she wasn't able to see her eldest daughter, who lives in Australia. Then, last Christmas, global restrictions eased and Daisy Han came home for a visit.Qi wanted to do something special, so she bought her an Apple Watch.""I just want to surprise her,"" she told Go Public from her home in southern Ontario. ""She was so happy.""When Han went home to Sydney, she discovered the watch's features that rely on data were not compatible with telecommunications networks in Australia. She mailed it back to her mom, so she could return it.Han paid about $50 to send it via Australia Post, and it was cleared by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).But Qi didn't get it.Got a story? Email the Go Public teamOn Jan. 25, Qi went to pick up the package at a local Canada Post office. She says when the clerk brought it out, the box looked like it had been opened. It felt like there was nothing inside. She says the employee told her that's how it arrived at the location, so she took the package home.""I pay their customs duty fees. I take [the box] home, then nothing in there,"" said Qi.""They just give me just empty box. Nothing in there.""After Go Public contacted Canada Post, it agreed to reimburse the $475.67 Qi paid for the Apple Watch, as a show of goodwill. Australia Post compensated Han $137 in Australian dollars (about $100 Cdn) and also called it a goodwill gesture.Australia Post told Go Public via email that the package was safely delivered to Canadian custom authorities, and CBSA says it passed through customs without being opened — officially. Qi believes all this points to one thing, that a Canada Post employee must have stolen the watch right out of the box. The waybill on the package said it contained an ""Apple Watch SE.""Australia Post says the package was safely delivered to Canadian customs authorities who, in turn, say it passed through customs without being opened. Qi believes a Canada Post employee must have stolen the watch right out of the box.

A consumer protection expert says insurance exists for a reason.""It is really important for people to understand the risks that they are going to assume in shipping goods,"" said Ken Whitehurst, executive director at the Consumers Council of Canada.Daisy Han says she paid extra to have the watch double packaged and for expedited shipping — options which she thought would keep it safe. (Kimberly Ivany/Zoom)He says unless you purchase insurance, you are essentially shipping at your own risk. Whitehurst agrees there's no way to know for sure what happened to the missing watch without a police investigation.Qi says she asked Canada Post to investigate but they closed the case without finding out what happened, so she looked into it herself.No proof, says post officeHer local post office suggested someone at CBSA could have opened the box. CBSA told her there is no record the package was inspected and that, if it had been, there would be yellow tape on it, which there was not.Qi says Canada Post wouldn't accept her suspicions.

I did everything in my power, did my investigation, then everything indicates that somebody open, open this box stealing the watch in Post Canada,"" she said.She says the postal service told her if she believes a crime was committed, she should call the police.Qi wishes she had trusted her instincts and not taken the package home unopened. She believes if she had opened it in front of the Canada Post employee there would be no doubt the watch had been stolen.""I feel like I'm so stupid. I should have opened that in front of her and called the police right there so they can't tell me I can't prove it,"" said Qi.Canada Post says there's no way to know where the watch went missing — having been 'handled many times, and by many people, on its way from Australia.' (Canadian Press)Go Public asked Canada Post for any statistics on complaints of theft by its employees. It did not respond.Last year a 58-year-old postal worker was charged in Winnipeg for stealing parcels with a combined value of more than $40,000.And in 2019, a Bear River, N.S., mailman was charged with stealing mail in the Digby area.Get the insuranceInitially, Australia Post refunded Han $137 in Australian dollars (about $128 Cdn), per its standard coverage against loss or damage.In an email, a spokesperson told Han that, in the future, she should buy insurance when mailing valuable items.Han says she had already paid extra to have the watch wrapped in two packages and sealed, and opted for expedited shipping which was another added cost. She thought those options would make it safer.Qi gave her daughter, right, the watch as a Christmas gift, but its features were incompatible with the telecommunications services in Australia. (Submitted by Emily Han)She says she understands that insurance exists for a reason, but says it should be used to cover uncontrollable circumstances or accidents — not theft by what she also believes to have been a postal employee.""If the package was stolen from our porch in Canada and I don't have insurance … then absolutely that would be on me,"" she said. ""But the fact is, the package was opened at some point of being handled … Why should the onus be on the customer to pay all this extra money for insurance to prevent against that kind of scenario?""Whitehurst, the consumer advocate, says people shipping valuable goods should consider getting insurance if they want to avoid situations like this.Shipping services are ""not likely to return or pay you for goods that you didn't insure when they have an insurance program,"" he said.""While it's not right that people aren't better protected, they also have to be realistic and understand that their protections are limited.""Whitehurst also says shipping companies have to make that clear to their customers at the outset.Qi says Canada Post should do more to protect consumers and stop internal ""criminal activities.""""I feel like they they don't care,"" she said.

CBC;Ontario lakeside towns push to regulate short-term rentals to preserve their way of life;"There's a growing movement among Ontario lakeside communities to push back against short-term rental services, such as Airbnb and VRBO, that some say are disrupting the social fabric of their close-knit rural communities to the point where it could upend their way of life.The Municipality of Lambton Shores is the latest to look at more stringent regulations for the beach communities of Port Franks, Ipperwash and Grand Bend, when council reviewed a draft bylaw on Tuesday to license short-term rentals, put a cap on occupancy at 10 people per dwelling and create a 24/7 hotline for locals to report nuisance parties.Port Stanley, a beach town on Lake Erie's shore that's part of Central Elgin municipality, is also considering a bylaw and recently voted 4-3 to study the issue to hopefully have a licensing scheme in place next year.""To me we needed to regulate it,"" said Mayor Sally Martyn, noting most homes sold in town often get scooped up by out-of-town investors looking to turn them into short-term rentals.

Testing is limited across the country and detailed COVID-19 data that's publicly available is also limited.""There is a dearth of testing that's happening and there's some information coming out to suggest that the rapid antigen tests are not as accurate as we hoped against Omicron,"" said Jennifer Gommerman, professor of immunology at the University of Toronto, and the Canada Research Chair in tissue specific immunity.""Prevalence is a difficult question to answer, but we know that there's lots of virus going around.""PCR test-positivity rates, hospitalization figures, and wastewater data in many provinces are showing increased transmission of the virus.And data from around the world do show reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, experts say.""When we think about this idea of reinfection, we have to appreciate we are still facing a virus that has a unique ability to circumvent those early defences from neutralizing antibodies,"" said Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist and assistant professor in medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.Yet, reinfection cases largely do not cause worse symptoms of the disease, said Kindrachuk, who is also the Canada Research Chair in the molecular pathogenesis of emerging viruses.There are many factors as to why someone may be reinfected with the virus, and researchers are trying to get a better understanding of reinfections and what it means during Omicron.PCR testing data in Canada is limited so many Canadians have turned to rapid tests to see if they have COVID-19. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)Reinfections rising in global dataData released by Public Health Ontario last week shows some 11,730 Ontarians have been reinfected with COVID-19 since November 2020.Reinfection, according to Ontario health officials, is when someone has had two lab-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 with evidence that these were ""separate infections caused by different viral lineages.""South African scientists had warned in December that reinfections among people who've already battled COVID-19 appeared to be more likely with Omicron than with earlier coronavirus mutants.A recent rise in reinfections has been seen in parts of the world like the United Kingdom, which had a similar vaccine rollout to Canada.Before Dec. 6, the proportion of daily cases in England thought to be reinfections had been below two per cent for nearly six months.That rate is estimated to have risen to 9.9 per cent as of February, a Reuters analysis of UKHSA data found.In Italy, a spokesman for the National Institute of Health said in February that reinfection cases stood at around three per cent of all infections, up from around 1.5 per cent before Omicron.Why does reinfection happen?There are a lot of factors as to why someone is reinfected with COVID-19, including vaccination status and when a person got a vaccine or infection, said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at University of Alberta in Edmonton.A study done in Qatar published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month found recovering from a previous infection was approximately 90 per cent effective at preventing reinfection from the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants.Protection against reinfection with the Omicron variant was lower at 60 per cent but ""still considerable,"" said the authors.Another important aspect of the risk of reinfection is vaccine-induced immunity.Experts are recommending that people get a booster shot to better protect themselves from COVID-19. (Hannah Beier/Reuters)The strength of immune response will partially depend on a person's age and overall health. The very old, very young, and immunocompromised will have weakened responses, for example.That's why fourth doses are now being rolled out to the more vulnerable populations across the country.And although vaccines have repeatedly been proven effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization, Omicron is still ""quite good at punching through the equivalent of two doses and in many cases, two doses plus infection or three doses,"" said Saxinger.The Dose 24:11 Do I need a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine? COVID case counts are once again climbing in many parts of Canada along with hospitalizations. This week, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine be given to all Canadians ages 80 and up. 24:11It's known that antibodies do drop off over time after someone is vaccinated or infected, said Benoit Barbeau, a professor in the biological science department at Université du Québec à Montréal who studies virology.""So if you've been infected in December or early January, you'd already have less levels of antibodies. It doesn't mean that you've totally lost your protection against infection, but definitely you'll have less protection than say 10 days after being infected,"" he said.The good news is that the immune response generated through vaccination ""is strong enough to keep us from getting really severe disease and ending up in hospital,"" said Gommerman.That's why experts are recommending people get a booster shot for that added protection.As for the Omicron subvariant BA.2, early research out of Denmark hints that reinfections with that strain seem rare.What do we need to learn?Barbeau said as parts of Canada and other countries deal with a sixth wave, more data will emerge on who is getting reinfected and why.""There'll be other variants. The risk of reinfection will always be there,"" he said.But he emphasized that the immunity in the population, whether from vaccines or prior infection, is building up and allowing us to reduce transmission and hospitalization.All of this is happening as research continues into improving vaccines, whether it's adapting to new variants or research into new methods to administer vaccines like through the nasal cavity, he said.""It's very important to continue improving the vaccines.""";"Testing is limited across the country and detailed COVID-19 data that's publicly available is also limited.And data from around the world do show reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, experts say.PCR testing data in Canada is limited so many Canadians have turned to rapid tests to see if they have COVID-19.Protection against reinfection with the Omicron variant was lower at 60 per cent but ""still considerable,"" said the authors.As for the Omicron subvariant BA.2, early research out of Denmark hints that reinfections with that strain seem rare.";['cent', 'know', 'age', 'cases', 'twice', 'getting', 'data', 'research', 'reinfections', 'infection', 'reinfection', 'omicron', 'vaccines', 'far', 'covid19'];0.12117093945016022;positive

Even if she couldn't give any land back, she did give me many orgasms,"" says TallBear, reading an anonymous confession written and submitted by an audience member at a show during Toronto's 2019 Queer Film Festival.The crowd hoots, hollers and cheers.Tipi Confessions is a live theatre event, with its co-creators and hosts reflecting on sexual desire and sex positivity through an Indigenous lens. Alongside sexy storytelling and performances, the night is punctuated by the anonymous audience confessions.Some confessions are all about the laughs. Others, about being vulnerable.""I confess, I have often had sex more for others' pleasure than my own. This bothers me,"" read co-founder Tracy Bear at a 2015 event in Edmonton, eliciting a sympathetic ""aww"" from the crowd.Kim TallBear speaks at a Tipi Confessions event in 2017 in Vancouver. (Jun Kamata)TallBear, who is an Indigenous scholar of science, technology and sex at the University of Alberta, created Tipi Confessions in 2015, with Bear and Kirsten Lindquist, as a play on the Texas show Bedpost Confessions.""I think that it provides people an opportunity to sit there in an audience, of sometimes a few hundred people, and realize that we all have these awkward, difficult, hurtful, challenging and joyful moments that we can bring into a conversation about sexuality,"" TallBear told Unreserved's Rosanna Deerchild.And they're not the only ones exploring this. Indigenous creators across several artistic disciplines are rediscovering and reclaiming their sexuality through their work — sometimes for fun, other times as a direct response to the effects of colonialism.That work could take the form of Kanina Terry's Hide Babes Calendar, featuring pinup photos of Indigenous men and women in sexy outfits made of moose or deer hide — a style she dubs ""bushoir.""""Our bodies are sacred. And I think having a beautiful, soft, sacred hide next to them is … for me, it's just such an amazing feeling,"" said Terry, who is Anishinaabe-kwe from Lac Seul First Nation in Ontario.Or Edmonton artist Tashina Makokis, who makes earrings resembling vulvas out of moosehide strips, Swarovski crystals — and thematically appropriate beaver hair.Vulva earrings by Tashina Makokis, made with moosehide, pink moonstones, Swarovski crystals and 'a landing strip' of beaver fur. (Tashina Makokis/Instagram)Indigenous erotica in literatureIt's a more diverse landscape compared to when author and publisher Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm first started looking for Indigenous erotica more than 20 years ago.At the time, she was surprised to find almost none. When she asked writers she knew about the topic, most realized it wasn't even on their radar.Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm is an Anishinaabe writer. In 2003, she released the collection Without Reservation: Indigenous Erotica. (Submitted by Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm )""I'd see a light bulb go off over people's heads when I broached the subject. They would ... start to realize, like, 'Why am I not writing about it?'"" she said.""But when I actually started talking to people, you know, it was just welcomed. People really wanted to have those conversations.""The result of those conversations was Without Reservation: Indigenous Erotica, a collection of poetry and prose by Indigenous writers around the world including Canada, the U.S., Australia and Aotearoa (New Zealand).It's beautiful for us to love each other. It's beautiful for us to love ourselves. - Kateri Akiwenzie-DammAkiwenzie-Damm said she sought out a wide diversity of content for the collection, but she wasn't interested in submissions that were mostly about dominance or violence.""I was really looking for positivity [and] for positive reflections of Indigenous people loving each other,"" she explained.TallBear shares that sentiment, saying that one of the influences behind these stories is a need to break free from the legacy of colonialism, including residential schools in Canada — which erased cultural memories of all kinds.""When we talk about sex and Indigenous people, it shouldn't just be trauma,"" TallBear said. ""It shouldn't just be that it was turned into a weapon of violence by the settler state and all of its horrible institutions. It's also a way to share joy and power among each other and our intimates.""TallBear has researched how European settlers forced their views of gender, marriage and property on Indigenous populations as part of their assimilation efforts.""For them, the heads of households can only be men. Marriages are supposed to be monogamous and heterosexual, and they're supposed to last forever"" — a far cry from some First Nations cultures, she explained, where polyamorous or LGBT relationships were common.Left to right: Co-founders TallBear, Tracy Bear and Kirsten Lindquist speak at a Tipi Confessions event in 2017 in Vancouver. (Jun Kamata)Settlers unfamiliar with these kinds of relationships either described them as ""sexually promiscuous"" or strange — and didn't attempt to learn or record much else about them.""We're missing a lot from the archive, because they wrote down what they saw and they weren't ... capable of seeing everything,"" TallBear said.Reclaiming old traditions to build new onesTerry's path to the spicy side of photography began when she reconnected with a family tradition that had been previously lost.In 2017, she attended a hide tanning workshop in Thunder Bay, Ont. The craft used to be passed down through Terry's family. But the generation that was forced to attend residential schools, including Terry's mother, was never afforded the opportunity to learn that skill — and all the cultural knowledge that goes with it.That workshop set Terry on the path to becoming a skilled hide tanner herself. A few years later, she hit a moment of inspiration during an outdoor photoshoot while wearing lingerie and hide.""It's always just been about, you know, being myself and feeling confident about myself and who I am as an Indigenous woman out in the bush,"" said Terry.Terry says a friend who photographed her coined the term ""bushoir,"" and she loved it. Soon, the idea gained momentum. She collaborated with friends and fellow artists to make the first Indigenous Hide Babes calendar in 2021, with a second out now for 2022.""There's some women, there's some men, there's some awesome hot boys in drag,"" she said of the 2022 edition.A page from Terry's 2022 Indigenous Hide Babes calendar. (Submitted by Kanina Terry)She also has a non-bushoir calendar out this year for those who are looking to celebrate hide art and fashion in a more G-rated, all-ages context.Terry has received a lot of positive reactions to her calendars. But the most poignant review might be from her eldest aunt, who wrote her a letter reminiscing about how she used to tan hides when she was younger.Terry hopes her work helps Indigenous people become more comfortable with themselves and learn more about sex positivity.And Akiwenzie-Damm shares that vision. ""We needed to reclaim that in order to be fully who we are and to recognize that it's beautiful for us to love each other,"" she said.

He rose to No. 1 in the world by winning the Match Play two weeks ago in Texas.And now this.Scheffler, who finished at 10-under 278, won $2.7 million US from the $15 million prize fund. That brings his total to $8,872,200 over his last six starts.Scheffler's big moment came early in the round, and it was no less significant.Starting the final round with a three-shot lead, he watched Smith open with two straight birdies to the cut the deficit to one, and then Scheffler's approach from the pine needles left of the third fairway came up short and rolled back down the slope.His pitch was racing toward the hole when it banged into the pin and dropped for an unlikely birdie, and a two-shot swing when Smith from the same position made bogey.No one got closer than three the rest of the way. Only the contenders changed.Smith's hopes end on 12th holeThe 12th hole remains the most riveting par 3 in golf, the scene of more collapses than comebacks. Smith became the latest victim.Coming off birdie at No. 11, his shot was still in the air when he let his club slip through his hands and he slowly closed his eyes twice as it splashed into Rae's Creek. The next shot wasn't much better, but at least dry, and Smith's hopes ended there with a triple bogey.He was three behind standing on the 12th tee. Three holes later, he was eight back.From there, any hope resided with McIlroy. All he needed to complete the career Grand Slam was to match the best final round in Masters history and get some help from Scheffler. He only got one of those and had to settle for his first silver medal from Augusta.Not that he didn't create some Sunday magic. McIlroy went bunker-to-bunker on the 18th hole, leaving himself right of the green and aiming some 25 feet right of the flag. It rode the slope all the way into the hole, setting off one of the loudest roars of the week.Morikawa followed him in from the same bunker, different angle, and McIlroy could only laugh.""This tournament never ceases to amaze,"" McIlroy said.

""It was almost like a badge of honour.""It wasn't the only time Eamon, originally from Hammonds Plains, N.S., went to hospital because of excessive drinking.From 2008 to 2013, alcohol was a big part of Eamon's life. Her struggles with alcohol eventually led her to drop out of university.Prestigious scholarshipBut Eamon is now back at university, this time at Saint Mary's in Halifax. Sober for more than eight years, the 28-year-old just landed a prestigious Frank H. Sobey scholarship worth $35,000, one of nine given out annually to undergraduate business students in Atlantic Canada. She has a year left in her studies.As part of her application for the scholarship, which included reference letters, written essays and an interview process, Eamon talked about her sobriety.""I wanted to show that it is a possibility for people to change, for people to grow, for people to survive substance-use disorder,"" she said.Eamon started drinking when she went to C.P. Allen High School in Bedford, N.S., and liked the confidence it gave her. She believed alcohol was part of the package that included new friends, big parties and adventure.'The alcohol sort of took over'Even though Eamon skipped a lot of classes, she kept her grades up. She graduated in 2011, and wanting to go somewhere bigger than Halifax, she decided on Ottawa.""And when I got into university, the alcohol sort of took over,"" said Eamon.Eamon is shown in a photo from her time at Carleton University. Students in residence would wear these red sweaters and they could have their nicknames printed on the sleeve. 'Naturally everyone agreed on my nickname, and I paid actual money to have that branded on my sweater,' she says. (Submitted by Laura Eamon)In her first year, she lived in residence. She failed a few classes and barely scraped by in the others, missing a lot of instruction time along the way.Eamon headed home for the summer with a friend, Kassie Nadler. The two split a place in downtown Halifax, but Nadler left after about a month.""She packed up all of her stuff and said, 'I can't do this anymore. It's impossible to live with you and you're ruining my time here. You are sick and this is too much. Something's got to change. And I'll see you in Ottawa in September,'"" said Eamon. ""And she left.""The experience was a first for Eamon. No one had told her that her drinking was problematic.Nadler told CBC News this was actually the second time she had a conversation like that with her best friend. The previous time was during their first year of university.Then 18, the pair would often head to nearby Gatineau, Que., where the legal drinking age is 18, so they could go to clubs. Eamon would often black out from drinking.""I can't take care of you in those moments where you need me to,"" Nadler told Eamon at the time. ""And I'm not physically capable and I can't make sure that you're safe, and it puts me in an uncomfortable position.""For their second year of university, the pair lived off-campus and had other roommates.Eamon said she knew something was wrong when her roommates were able to balance their studies, work and maintain a social life, but she couldn't.""They were thriving, and I was sad and lonely and sick,"" said Eamon.Within a week, she dropped out. She got a job and worked to pay for her rent and alcohol.Early the following year, Eamon moved home. She continued drinking, couch-surfed and worked a series of jobs in retail and reception when she wasn't calling in sick for the day.""I feel bad for all the customers who I dealt with … I was pretty haggard-looking and rough around the edges, probably cranky all the time,"" said Eamon.Eamon bikes on P.E.I.'s Confederation Trail in the summer of 2021. (Submitted by Laura Eamon)One day that summer in 2013, she woke up in a hotel room and didn't know where she was.She went to her first AA meeting that night and cried the entire time. At the end of the meeting, she had a realization.""How can you go to a bonfire or the beach or, you know, a cottage without drinking?"" said Eamon. ""I was, like, sobbing to this woman, just so concerned — not that I had woken up downtown in a place where I didn't even know existed, but because I was worried about going to the beach without alcohol.""Sober since Nov. 9, 2013Eamon wasn't ready to quit drinking, but on Nov. 9, 2013, she went to AA after she was sexually assaulted.""I knew I didn't want to ever be in a situation like that again if I could help it, and the only thing that I could control was my own actions,"" said Eamon. ""And that's really where my sobriety started.""Eamon has been sober ever since. She said being surrounded by people who had similar experiences helped her maintain her sobriety. Her father was also an important resource. He was also a recovering alcoholic who had been sober since before Eamon was born.Growing up, Eamon attended meetings with her father on his sobriety birthdays.Life without alcohol was different. She didn't have mysterious bruises and pulled muscles and other injuries. Eamon also noticed she suddenly had extra money. It wasn't just the money saved from not buying alcohol  it was things like not buying fast food while drinking or the morning after, and not missing work and wages.Eamon also fell in love.""All of a sudden, I was experiencing joy,"" she said.Eamon is now a stepmom. Her partner has two kids from a previous marriage.She also got a diploma in medical office administration and started working in the health-care system, but she longed for a bigger challenge and applied to Saint Mary's University in 2017 and started attending the school.Needing a 'Hail Mary'She's balanced working in different positions — she's currently a project co-ordinator with the Sackville Business Association — and going to school while taking less than a full course load.Since giving up drinking, it hasn't been all joy for Eamon. Her father died due to cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and her mother had a brain aneurysm, but has fully recovered.Finding the money to pay for school has been another challenge. Needing a ""Hail Mary,"" she learned of the Sobeys scholarship. Looking at the past recipients, she felt intimidated by their success.""And my partner was just saying, you know, 'You're pretty incredible, too. Why don't you apply?'"" said Eamon.Part of the application process included talking about volunteer experience. Eamon's volunteer work includes sitting on the board of the Sackville Rivers Association and acting as the communications chair for the organization, which is the community where she now lives. She's the treasurer of the Saint Mary's University Environmental Society.Eamon is also involved with the Halifax Recovery Society, a non-profit focused on breaking down the stigma of mental health and substance-use disorders. For their 2021 Recovery Day event, Eamon told her story.Breaking the stigma of addictionJulie Melanson is the society's founder. She said when people like Eamon tell their stories, it helps break down stigma.Julie Melanson is the founder of the Halifax Recovery Society. She says success stories, like that of Eamon, help make it easier for people struggling with substance-use disorder to seek help. (Submitted by Julie Melanson)""People are able to relate,"" said Melanson. ""They could hear themselves through that story and know that they're not alone, so it's incredibly important for stories to be shared, like Laura's, in a place where it's public, where it can be viewed, not behind closed doors, because we need to normalize conversations to really break that societal stigma.""Melanson said the stories also offer hope.""It really shows that we can recover, we do recover and we do succeed in great ways, so it's absolutely phenomenal,"" said Melanson.'Still just funny and outgoing,' says friendWhile on opposite ends of the country, Nadler and Eamon remain friends. They've also taken road trips together over the years. While Eamon's confidence has grown, in other ways she hasn't changed.""She was still the same Laura that I met on the first day that I went to Carleton for the group tour, still just funny and outgoing and social and very interested in the world around her and in the people that she surrounds herself with,"" said Nadler.When Eamon learned she had won the scholarship, the celebration was simple: she and her partner got Chinese food.""I think I've turned into a homebody and I'm comfortable with that,"" she said.

CBC;Some insects are disappearing, and that could put humans at risk, says author;"Read Story TranscriptWhile you may wish bugs would buzz off sometimes, climate writer Oliver Milman says we wouldn't want to live in a world without them.""We wouldn't survive there for very long,"" Milman told The Current guest host Duncan McCue.Milman writes for The Guardian in the U.K. and is the author of the book, The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires That Run the World, which will be released in March.While it might not outright be an insect doomsday, Milman says we have seen a dramatic decline in insect populations. Milman referenced a study in rural Denmark, which found a decline of 80 to 97 per cent of insects on hitting vehicles' windshields over two decades, from 1997 to 2017.And a long-term study in Germany that concluded in 2017 found that that annual average weight of flying insects caught in traps has dropped by 76 per cent since 1989.Milman says it's been happening for a variety of reasons, including habitat loss from construction, pesticide use, and climate change, he explained.He said if we continue like this, some insects will disappear, while others will grow.Bugs are essential for pollinating plants such as alfalfa. (CBC)""Mosquitoes [habitat] range is expanding because of what we're doing rather than contracting,"" said Milman.""A lot of [insects] that we are losing, those half a million species that are likely to go down the drain, are [insects] we find kind of beautiful and lovely and useful for us,"" he added, referencing an analysis by two Australia-based scientists, Francisco Sánchez-Bayo and Kris Wyckhuys, that anticipate the dramatic loss in species over the next few decades.He said a world without bugs would have serious effects on everything from the environment to the availability of chocolate and ice cream.For example, we would see more corpses of small animals and feces lying around, as beetles get rid of those for us by eating them.He also said a third of the foods we eat would shrivel up and die without the pollination provided by insects. That includes tiny midges that pollinate the plant used for chocolate, as well as insects that pollinate alfalfa, which cows eat.While some insect populations are on the decline, mosquito population is on the rise. (CBC)""You'd be left with the vegan stuff,"" said Milman.But don't go out and panic buy tubs of ice cream just yet.""Luckily, I don't think we're going to ever see that because I think insects will outlive us on this planet. The issue is that we are creating a world that is changing the composition of insects,"" he said.Soccer-playing bees?Based on some of the abilities insects have, the next time someone tells you to stop ""bugging"" them, you should take that as a compliment. Milman is concerned the reputation of insects isn't matching up with their usefulness and intelligence.Take the humble bee, for example.Bees can be trained to play soccer if given food incentives. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images)""It's been shown that they can count  you can teach them to play soccer. They have incredible logistical abilities to travel between plants,"" he said.Or ants, that can act as paramedics to treat other ants in the colony.What can be done?Milman said countries are already finding replacements for insects. That includes robot bees, or a drone that can pollinate apple orchards.Others are trying to slow down the extinction of insects, like enacting pesticide bans throughout the European Union, or cutting down on light pollution — which may deter some moths from laying eggs and puts other insects at risk of being seen by predators — in Germany.People can plant milkweed, a food source of the Monarch, to help the butterfly. (Evan Buhler/The Canadian Press)But other solutions are surprisingly simple. This includes planting milkweed, a food source for Monarch butterflies, or just letting your lawn grow, allowing for more plants and habitats insects.""Insects would just appreciate it if we just let things go a bit. You don't have to rake your yard of leaves every time. You can let the grass grow a little bit,"" said Milman.Written by Philip Drost.

CBC;Loblaws bringing Frito-Lay chips back to shelves, ending months-long pricing dispute;"Loblaws will start restocking Frito-Lay products on Monday, ending a months-long absence due to a pricing dispute between the companies, CBC News has confirmed.Frito-Lay — the PepsiCo-owned maker of snack brands such as Cheetos, Doritos, Lays, Ruffles and Sunchips — set off an unexpected food fight in February when it abruptly cut off one of Canada's biggest grocery chains because of its refusal to raise prices.The company said in February it took the extraordinary step because it is facing ""unprecedented pressures from rising costs of items, including ingredients, packaging and transportation."" It was pushing Loblaws to charge customers more for their products in order to recoup those higher costs, Frito-Lay said.But Loblaws refused to pass on those costs, with the grocery chain saying it is ""laser focused"" on keeping prices as low as possible.The Financial Post was first to report of a deal between Loblaws and PepsiCo.When contacted by CBC News, a Loblaws spokesperson gave no details about any deal but said ""we're happy to once again have a wide assortment in our chip aisle.""""All along, this was about providing value to our customers,"" the spokesperson said in an email to CBC News on Saturday.The Loblaws spokesperson added that stores were expected to be fully stocked with Frito-Lay products before the upcoming Easter weekend.";"Loblaws will start restocking Frito-Lay products on Monday, ending a months-long absence due to a pricing dispute between the companies, CBC News has confirmed.It was pushing Loblaws to charge customers more for their products in order to recoup those higher costs, Frito-Lay said.The Financial Post was first to report of a deal between Loblaws and PepsiCo.""All along, this was about providing value to our customers,"" the spokesperson said in an email to CBC News on Saturday.The Loblaws spokesperson added that stores were expected to be fully stocked with Frito-Lay products before the upcoming Easter weekend.";['loblaws', 'fritolay', 'products', 'shelves', 'chips', 'monthslong', 'bringing', 'costs', 'deal', 'grocery', 'ending', 'dispute', 'customers', 'wide', 'pricing', 'cbc', 'spokesperson'];0.15805555555555553;positive

CBC;How Canada helped shape pop-punk;"Written by Niko StratisTo us, the flyer on the counter was everything. The skate shop in the mall downtown had a piece of paper taped to the glass countertop, obscuring the rows of skate deck trucks and silicon wheels in the glass case below, that advertised the event of the 1999 summer season. Gob was coming, and they were going to play in a small community a mere two-hour drive from Whitehorse, where I grew up.My friends and I could hardly believe it. Gob's second album, How Far Shallow Takes You, released on Vancouver's Mint Records, was a permanent fixture in the Discman tethered by a cassette adapter to the stereo of my 1988 Datsun Maxima. This development was monumental, a testament to what was possible in our small, isolated city. If Gob was coming, the expanse of the future widened ahead of us, opening an infinite amount of doors.Langley, British Columbia's Gob came onto the scene right as pop-punk began to emerge from DIY clubs and off-hours bowling alleys onto national stages. The band's debut record, Too Late…No Friends, released in 1995 on Mint Records, was an early benchmark in Canadian pop-punk. Local scenes from coast to coast were chock-a-block with punk-rock bands laying waste to garages and all-ages venues, but it was a rare occurrence when kids like me, locked up in the frozen north, heard about them. Being able to go to our local CD store and buy that Gob album was a signifier that this was a band that mattered.Punk-rock was egalitarian. Every city in the country had an emergent punk scene: B.C. had NoMeansNo  Winnipeg had Propagandhi. But it was Alberta that set the groundwork for pop-punk to flourish with Calgary's Chixdiggit.Chixdiggit was a branding exercise turned Ramonescore pop-punk band. After selling shirts emblazoned with its logo at its high school, the band swiftly realized brand recognition is nothing without a product to back it up. Chixdiggit was formed in 1990 by K.J. Jansen, Mark O'Flaherty and Mike Eggermont, who all divided up instruments among themselves, despite not yet knowing how to play them.Chixdiggit went on to sign with Seattle's iconic Sub Pop records on the strength of the band's now-legendary ability to craft unforgettable pop-punk earworms in under two minutes. Its inaugural self-titled album was released in 1996, as one of the first Canadian bands ever signed to the label that launched Nirvana. (New Brunswick's Eric's Trip being the first in 1993.)In the waning days of the '90s, bands like Blink-182 led pop-punk away from circle pits in dimly lit basements to festival stages sponsored by Budweiser. The emergence of pop-punk as a musical endeavour that had wide-ranging appeal changed the landscape for punk-rock audiences nationwide. Pop-punk had suddenly turned a corner, off the little back roads that we held like secrets and onto roads much more well traveled. Some of us bristled as pop-punk grew in popularity, transcending from niche interest to national sensation.We felt betrayed, in a way. We cried sellout until our throats were hoarse as musicians jumped onto the runaway bandwagon of pop-punk. Even bands like Gob signed with bigger labels and took a fine cloth to their harder edges, sanding the roughly hewn sounds until they worked on daytime radio stations in target markets.But while the likes of Gob and Chixidiggit were instrumental in building the foundation of pop-punk in Canada, the turn of the millennium introduced us to an array of artists who made seismic impacts on the scene, leaving an indelible Canadian-shaped mark on the history of pop-punk.The 2000s: bidding wars, awards and mainstream successIn June 2000, Ajax, Ontario's Sum 41 released an EP titled Half Hour of Power to almost overnight success. (At 11 songs, the EP was also sometimes considered the band's debut full-length.) ""Makes No Difference,"" the breakout single from that EP, became omnipresent. The band proliferated MuchMusic countdowns and quickly became the darling of opening slots for now-mainstream bands like the Offspring and Blink-182. It wouldn't be long before Sum 41's debut went platinum in Canada, and the band was the headliner of its own parade, a runaway freight train of unabashed pop-fuelled punk and metal clichés crafted into undeniable commercial success.Meanwhile, at a Shania Twain concert in Ontario a year earlier, a young Avril Lavigne won a radio contest for an opportunity to sing onstage with the Canadian icon. There, in front of 20,000 relative strangers, the two duetted on ""What Made You Say That."" Lavigne remarked to Twain that her goal was to become a famous singer.That wish was shortly granted, when Lavigne was discovered singing country covers at a bookstore in Kingston, Ont. What followed was a tornado of bidding wars that ultimately landed with Lavigne signing a deal with Arista Records, who also enlisted Ajax, Ontario's Closet Monster to play the part of her backing band.Lavigne's debut record, 2002's Let Go, was such a smashing success that it borders on unnecessary to describe. On the strength of hits like ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi,"" Lavigne ascended to stardom on a runaway escalator. The songs appealed to the very core of their target demographic's feelings of alienation and dissatisfaction, those felt by teens in malls all over the world. Not just a financial success, Lavigne easily won the hearts of critics, earning best new artist at the 2002 MTV Music Video Awards, Junos for album and pop album of the year, and even nabbing a Grammy nomination for best pop vocal album.Lavigne is often labelled a pop-punk princess, a coronation held when she was only 18 years old. It's a genre definition that causes friction in music fandoms, with harsh critics arguing that there's very little punk found in a million-dollar marketing ploy by a major record label. Some critics took umbrage with Lavigne's lyrical content, saying the singer had a lot of growing up to do as a pop artist, ignoring the obvious fact that the singer was indeed still a teenager. But the reality of Lavigne's impact on Canadian music is undeniable and everlasting. ""Sk8er Boi"" lives on not just as an earworm and bonafide hit, it's a popular meme format to this day, 20 years after its debut.2002 gave us the Montreal-based Simple Plan, a group spearheaded by former members of the pop-punk band Reset. Simple Plan released its debut album, No Pads, No Helmets…Just Balls, on Atlantic Records, and despite some critics drawing unavoidable parallels to acts like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, the Quebec quartet set about immediately establishing itself as a powerhouse of pop-punk.On the back of singles like ""I'd Do Anything"" (which featured Blink-182's Mark Hoppus on guest vocals) and ""Perfect,"" the band catapulted in short order to venerated stages like the long-running Vans Warped Tour, and opening slots for Green Day and Good Charlotte.No Pads, No Helmets…Just Balls is certified double platinum in both Canada and the U.S., meaning shipments of two million records for the band. Simple Plan climbed Billboard charts, recorded the theme song for the newly rebooted Scooby-Doo and, in the perfect confluence of Canadian pop-punk dominion, toured as the openers for Avril Lavigne.From the early days of punk bands leaning into their natural instincts to write catchy hook-laden songs to artists like Lavigne, Sum 41 and Simple Plan becoming so steeped in fame, the impact that Canada has had on the formation and longevity of pop-punk is undeniable.Lavigne changed the game the same way that bands like Gob and Chixdiggit did, but she did it on arena stages and a major label. Lavigne was a woman singing songs about feeling alienated — the love and loss and confusion of her whirlwind teen years — in the same vein as so many others. Her success lies in her standing tall as a pastiche of youth subcultures that millions could find themselves reflected in, shining bright from the biggest stages she could find.Pop-punk has grown and shifted in the decades since its inception. Bands like Meet Me @ The Altar, Pinkshift, Magnolia Park and even recent Grammy Award-winner Olivia Rodrigo are making new waves in a scene many are quick to write off as an ocean of nostalgia.While some of the prominent forebearers of the genre stopped carrying the flag of pop-punk long ago, the impact they made on the scene remains. As pop-punk rose in prominence — into the radios, TVs, hearts and minds of adoring audiences — it was Canadian artists who rose to the challenge at the turn of the millennium and made themselves known. Not content to be footnotes in the history of pop-punk's formation, these artists opted instead to carve themselves into the headlines.";Langley, British Columbia's Gob came onto the scene right as pop-punk began to emerge from DIY clubs and off-hours bowling alleys onto national stages.The band's debut record, Too Late…No Friends, released in 1995 on Mint Records, was an early benchmark in Canadian pop-punk.Being able to go to our local CD store and buy that Gob album was a signifier that this was a band that mattered.Chixdiggit was a branding exercise turned Ramonescore pop-punk band.2002 gave us the Montreal-based Simple Plan, a group spearheaded by former members of the pop-punk band Reset.;['canada', 'band', 'stages', 'records', 'helped', 'album', 'poppunk', 'bands', 'gob', 'scene', 'shape', 'canadian', 'lavigne'];0.14473968183919636;positive

CBC;Tributes pour in for maestro Boris Brott after the renowned conductor was fatally struck by car;"Tributes are pouring in following news of the death of maestro Boris Brott, artistic director and conductor of the Orchestre classique de Montréal, who died Tuesday after a hit and run in Hamilton. He was 78.The orchestra shared the news in a Facebook post that called him its ""heart and soul.""""The entire OCM family is in a state of shock and disbelief,"" the orchestra's leadership said in the post.""[He was] an extraordinary ambassador of classical music, recognized beyond our borders, a mentor to countless young musicians and a very dear friend to many among them. His sudden death leaves a deep void in the music community and a great sadness in our hearts.""WATCH | Brott at work in 2013:Brott was a titan of classical music, both in Canada and internationally.

He became an officer of the Order of Canada in 1986.""The Brott Family is musical royalty in Canada, and it has been one of my greatest honours to know them as friends and to work with Boris over a period of almost 20 years,"" classical pianist Sara Davis Buechner wrote on Facebook. Buechner recalled performing Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto with Brott in the fall.""My condolences go out to all of Boris Brott's family, friends all over the world, and the many who were fortunate to hear his exalted performances during the course of a long and fantastically creative life.""Brott was also the founding artistic director of Hamilton's Brott Music Festival and the National Academy Orchestra.

CBC;Shawn Mendes' latest heartbreak anthem, and 6 more songs you need to hear this week;"Here at CBC Music, we're always on high alert for the best new songs by Canadian artists.This week, we're listening to new tracks from:Savannah Ré featuring Dylan Sinclair.Shawn Mendes.The Rural Alberta Advantage.Jeremie Albino.Grae.Nohidea featuring Maath You.Untradition.Scroll down to find out why you should listen, too.What new Canadian tunes are you currently obsessed with? Share them with us on Twitter @CBCMusic.Tune into CBC Music Mornings every Thursday to hear CBC Music's Jess Huddleston and Saroja Coehlo reveal which of these tracks is the standout new Canadian song.'Last One,' Savannah Ré feat. Dylan SinclairOn the heels of ""Fiji,"" her first song of 2022, Savannah Ré has dropped another single, this time with R&B singer Dylan Sinclair — and theirs is a vocal match made in heaven. The song's conceit is that this pair of lovers will each be the ""last one"" for the other, eclipsing all the rest. ""Something 'bout you feels so brand new,"" begins the gently swaying chorus, and while she never forces her voice, Ré's singing brims with urgency as she delivers the line, ""Nothing before matters no more."" When Sinclair enters for his verse, it's a ray of light. ""She's a song, she's a queen, she deserves it all,"" he ardently proclaims, his tenor voice a refreshing counterpoint to Ré's rich alto tones. They harmonize so inventively and beautifully in the second chorus, you'd think they'd been predestined to unite on this song. — Robert Rowat'When You're Gone,' Shawn MendesShawn Mendes' heartbreak era continues with his latest single, ""When You're Gone."" Following up last December's ""It'll Be Okay,"" Mendes' has poured the aftermath of his relationship with Camila Cabello into another new track. But whereas ""It'll Be Okay"" was a sombre piano ballad, ""When You're Gone"" finds Mendes back in his pop-rock comfort zone (with a dash of '80s synth near its end), crafting an anthemic song that will surely get audiences riled up on his upcoming world tour. ""I need to learn how to cope without you/ I'm trying to pretend myself but I don't really know how to,"" Mendes sings, admitting how lost he was after the breakup, unsure of who to turn to in moments of need now. But the pop star finds some solace in shouting out his feelings at the top of his lungs, almost desperate at times when he howls the chorus: ""Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone."" While Mendes leaves the song with no answers, it's the catharsis of the performance that feels like a step forward. — Melody Lau'3 Sisters,' the Rural Alberta AdvantageOh, moving onMissing out on the Saulte, lake-effect coming onOh, moving onIf I'm ever wrongI'll make it up before we're goneEvoking a particular place without sounding insincere or exclusive is a tricky balance, and the Rural Alberta Advantage has always been able to pinpoint that centre of gravity, building nostalgia and lore for a town even if you've never been. Now, after nearly five years without releasing music, the trio is back to its original formation of Nils Edenloff, Paul Banwatt and Amy Cole with a new EP, The Rise, and a frenetic, road-trip folk-rock single that'll make you want to jump in the car and head to the Alberta mountains for which the song's named. Edenloff and Cole are never just singing about place, of course, but the signposts are there, and when Banwatt lets loose on the drums in the second verse, everyone's on the road with them. The incredible cover art for the EP and singles also lends to the sense of travel: Edmonton-based photographer Leroy Schulz took stunning drone photos of the Alberta landscape from above, and it's a real mind game to figure out which way is up when you look at it. — Holly Gordon'Rollin,' Jeremie AlbinoThere's something particularly striking about a song that grips you immediately, especially when it's from a genre that you don't typically listen to. ""Rollin'"" is that type of song for me. Albino's passion permeates anything as limiting as genre, with a voice full of pure gusto and pathos. The folk and country artist just released his latest EP, Past Dawn, a collection of balmy, soulful tracks, rife with expert storytelling. ""Rollin'"" will transport you to a late summer evening, as the sunset casts a honeyed glow over everything. It's full of warmth, anticipation and possibility — a celebration of easy-living. — Kelsey Adams'Boxes,' GraeGrowing up is a process of gaining new things while letting go of the old. In the case of Toronto alt-pop artist Grae, the old consists of band tees that might not fit anymore and the collage of posters up on her bedroom wall. ""I looked around my room one day and realized I wanted to tear down all the posters I've had on my walls since I can remember,"" Grae said in a press release. ""That was a significant moment because I always thought I'd be that girl wearing a band t-shirt with posters covering her walls forever. But I needed a change."" That push-and-pull of wanting to move on, but having nostalgia constantly tug at you, is at the core of Grae's latest single, ""Boxes."" Throughout the track, she keeps reiterating that she's ""not that kid anymore,"" while also admitting how hard it is to confront the sentimentality embedded in her belongings. Those feelings are perfectly wrapped in the dreamy wash of guitar riffs and steady bass, almost sounding like a track that belongs in a past era. — ML'Joy,' nohidea feat. Maath YouOriginally from Calgary and now based in Los Angeles, nohidea is a pioneer of the Lo-Fi/chillhop movement that has exploded in recent years. His next album, Psychonautica, is due out June 17 and its first advance track, ""Joy,"" hints at a new direction for the seasoned producer. It's a hair-raising mashup of emo indie pop and Lo-Fi beats featuring the delicate vocals of Maath You (a.k.a. Matthew Wentworth of Our Last Night fame). ""Something greater than happiness surrounds us when we let go,"" he sings in the chorus, his voice floating on those last three words to invoke the song's title. The melodic contour recalls Coldplay's finest moments  production is economical but effective, beginning with birdsong and acoustic guitar before a descending cello line cues the beat. — RR'Elephant in the Room,' untraditionJulien Bowry, the producer and songwriter behind untradition, has distilled catharsis in his latest single, ""Elephant in the Room."" In an Instagram post, he shared that he first wrote the song in 2016, ""at a time that I thought (lol) would be my lowest point."" Over the years, he tweaked with the arrangement, time signature, musical structure and more until the song fell into place. The song-making process mimics the constant metamorphosis that Bowry himself was experiencing: ""In that time I feel as though I've been turned inside out by life, flattened, burned to a crisp, buried underground, and re-emerged countless times over."" The electric guitar acts as a sorrowful echo to Bowry's lamentations as he sings about ""drowning in shame"" and not being able to ""muster the strength of a whisper."" Over those six years, Bowry has created a deeply moving and intricately constructed ode to self-realization and healing. — KA";"The song's conceit is that this pair of lovers will each be the ""last one"" for the other, eclipsing all the rest.— Robert Rowat'When You're Gone,' Shawn MendesShawn Mendes' heartbreak era continues with his latest single, ""When You're Gone.""While Mendes leaves the song with no answers, it's the catharsis of the performance that feels like a step forward.That push-and-pull of wanting to move on, but having nostalgia constantly tug at you, is at the core of Grae's latest single, ""Boxes.""— RR'Elephant in the Room,' untraditionJulien Bowry, the producer and songwriter behind untradition, has distilled catharsis in his latest single, ""Elephant in the Room.""";['alberta', 'track', 'week', 'songs', 'gone', 'mendes', 'voice', 'anthem', 'youre', 'need', 'latest', 'heartbreak', 'shawn', 'song', 'single', 'hear'];0.16544597496520572;positive
CBC;Silk Sonic and Jon Batiste triumph, Zelensky appears at a classy Grammy Awards;"This year's Grammy Awards saw big wins by new artists, a handful of top-notch, well-produced performances and heartfelt tributes to artists who died this year — plus a surprise message from Ukraine's president.And host Trevor Noah limited himself to a single Will Smith joke.Here is CBC News' roundup of the highlights Sunday night.Jon Batiste, Silk Sonic, Olivia Rodrigo clean upAnderson .Paak, left, and Bruno Mars of Silk Sonic win record of the year for Leave The Door Open during the 64th Grammy Awards on Sunday in Las Vegas. After four wins, .Paak joked that the superduo were trying ""really hard"" to stay humble. (Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Trevor Noah kicked off the night with a nod to last week's Oscars debacle between Will Smith and Chris Rock. During his opening monologue, the comedian said, ""we're going to be listening to some music, we're going to be dancing, we're going to be singing, we're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths.""Music, singing, dancing, check. And several names remained quite popular throughout the show.Silk Sonic, a funk superduo comprising Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, were one of the night's clear winners. The group took home four statues for record of the year, song of the year, best R&B performance and best R&B song.This is the first year that Mars and .Paak have competed at the Grammys under the Silk Sonic moniker since announcing their self-titled album in early 2021. After winning record of the year, .Paak took the stage, joking, ""We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point. But in the industry we call that a clean sweep!""Jon Batiste, a multi-instrumentalist who rose to fame as bandleader of the group Stay Human and has served as musical director for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, had his moment Sunday night. The artist adds five trophies to his collection, including album of the year for We Are and best music video for Freedom.Olivia Rodrigo took home a healthy three awards this year, holding her own against Grammy heavyweights like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Mars in multiple categories. The 19-year old singer became pop's sweetheart last year with the release of her album Sour and its top single, Driver's License. Rodrigo was crowned best new artist and received trophies for best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance.Top-notch performances from Lil Nas X, BTSLil Nas X performs at Sunday's Grammy Awards. (Johnny Nunez/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Some truly inspired performances – all of different scale and style – punctuated the evening of award-giving. From Lil Nas X to BTS, high-octane musical sets were backdropped by intricate set design.Moody pop diva Billie Eilish performed her song Happier Than Ever, first appearing in a living room-like scene with furniture hanging from the ceiling and water flooding the floors. She then moved to the set's ""rooftop,"" joining her brother and producer Finneas as he shredded on the guitar, rain pouring onto the stage.Rap provocateur Lil Nas X gave a high-energy medley of songs from his debut studio album Montero, wowing with athletic choreography and a giant bust of his head on stage behind him and a swarm of dancers. He was briefly joined by rapper Jack Harlow to perform their hit song Industry Baby.But K-pop group BTS brought the house down with their performance of Butter, which began with members sitting in the audience: V was seen chatting Olivia Rodrigo up, while fan favourite Jung-kook descended from the rafters. They put on a tech-heavy, spy thriller-inspired performance of their song Butter, expertly navigating laser trip wires to deliver a memorable show.Zelensky pre-tapes message, Ukrainian artists performPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky speaks on a screen, asking for support. (Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)In one sobering moment, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky appeared in a pre-recorded message to the Grammy audience, trying to bolster support for the nation as it endures a war with Russia. The Grammys partnered with Global Citizen for its ""Stand Up for Ukraine campaign,"" dedicating a segment of the show to the country.""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" Zelensky said in his speech. ""Our musicians wear body armour instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them. But the music will break through anyway."" He asked the audience not to be silent, and to ""support us in any way you can.""After the message, singer John Legend took the stage for a performance of his new song, Free. He was joined by the Ukrainian poet and refugee Lyuba Yakimchuk, as well as Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton.Canadians at the Grammys ceremonyJoni Mitchell was this year's MusiCares' Person of the Year honoree at the Grammys.

The Toronto singer has rejected the Grammys since his album After Hours was shut out of nominations last year.Cuban Canadian performer Alex Cuba also picked up his first Grammy for best Latin pop album during the non-televised portion of the show. Montreal conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin also picked up his first Grammy for best orchestral performance.Justin Bieber attended the ceremony with wife Hailey Baldwin.

Belleville, Ont., rocker Avril Lavigne presented the award for Best Pop Duo Performance to Doja Cat and Sza.Legendary songbird Joni Mitchell was honoured as MusiCares Person of the Year earlier this month, but accepted a Grammy during the pre-show for a new category called Best Historical Album (her album Joni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963-1967) received the award). She also introduced a performance from singer Brandi Carlile alongside her longtime friend, 70s singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt.Taylor Hawkins, Stephen Sondheim rememberedFrom left to right, Ben Platt, Rachel Zegler, Cynthia Erivo, and Leslie Odom Jr. perform a tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim. (Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Rock band Foo Fighters received three bittersweet wins for their songs Making a Fire and Waiting on a War, from the album Medicine at Midnight, which won Best Rock Album. The band's drummer, Taylor Hawkins, died March 25 at age 50. While the long-running group was originally supposed to perform at the Grammys, they cancelled their set upon Hawkins's death.A tribute to Hawkins (and admiration from artists like Billie Eilish, who wore a T-shirt with Hawkins's face on it during her performance) preceded the in-memoriam segment. Biz Markie, Betty Davis, Charlie Watts, Meat Loaf, Ronnie Spector and Tom Parker were among those who died this year.The in-memoriam was accompanied by a performance of the late Stephen Sondheim's songs. A giant of 20th century musical theatre, several of Sondheim's works — including Somewhere from West Side Story and Send in the Clowns from A Little Night Music — were performed by Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo, Leslie Odom Jr. and Rachel Zegler, all of whom have roots on the stage.";Jon Batiste, Silk Sonic, Olivia Rodrigo clean upAnderson .Paak, left, and Bruno Mars of Silk Sonic win record of the year for Leave The Door Open during the 64th Grammy Awards on Sunday in Las Vegas.The group took home four statues for record of the year, song of the year, best R&B performance and best R&B song.Rodrigo was crowned best new artist and received trophies for best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance.Cuban Canadian performer Alex Cuba also picked up his first Grammy for best Latin pop album during the non-televised portion of the show.Belleville, Ont., rocker Avril Lavigne presented the award for Best Pop Duo Performance to Doja Cat and Sza.;['singer', 'best', 'recording', 'song', 'sonic', 'awards', 'album', 'silk', 'pop', 'took', 'grammy', 'jon', 'appears', 'performance', 'zelensky', 'classy', 'batiste', 'grammys', 'triumph'];0.2336906766073433;positive
CBC;Alex Cuba scores Grammy Award for album recorded in his B.C. home;"Alex Cuba was driving through a snowstorm near Quesnel, B.C., Sunday night when his name rang out a couple of thousand kilometres to the south at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas .The Afro-Cuban singer, born Alexis Puentes, was returning home with his wife and youngest son after two nights performing with the Okanagan Symphony Orchestra when he became a Grammy award winner for the best Latin pop album of the year, Mendó.Shortly after heavy snow began falling, Cuba said he received a phone call from his New York publicist who shared news of his first Grammy win.""I'm still in a little bit of a shock I think. It was very surreal,"" said the artist, reacting to his win Monday on CBC's B.C.

CBC;Latin musicians are creating a space in Canada, but some say there isn't enough support;"Growing up as a child in Montreal, Edi Cruz made it a hobby to record songs with friends and sing at local choirs.But the singer known today as Cruzito didn't discover his passion for reggaeton until he went back to visit his home country of Honduras as a teen.Then, he began recording reggaeton songs and used blogs and forums to share his work across Latin America.""When I was around 15, I started to record my own demos, I used to even produce my own beats,"" he told CBC News.There's no doubt Latin music has become mainstream over the last decade. In fact, it was the fifth most popular music genre in the U.S. in 2019, beating out the likes of country and EDM , according to Forbes.And while Latin artists and their music have made their way to several top charts over the years, some of them based in Canada say so much more can be done at home.As Cruzito's songs got more popular, he caught the attention of Raphy Pina, producer of Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee. Pina reached out to set up a meeting.""I was one of the few artists here in Montreal that got signed overseas,"" said Cruzito. ""I got to work with all these artists, I got to tour, I got to do stadiums — I got to do a lot of shows.""After putting his career on pause when he had a child, Cruzito came back to the music scene in 2017, but he signed with another label: Montreal's Joy Ride Records. In doing so, he became the first Hispanic-Latino artist on Joy Ride's roster.""When we started working with the CEO of Joy Ride, Carlos Munoz, who is also Latino, we got this idea that we could bring the Latin scene forward and do more,"" Cruzito said.""It's all about creating a movement here in Canada, and Quebec, to make sure that everybody is aware that the Latino music and the Latino scene is very powerful right now.""With this idea in mind, Cruzito, Munoz and Joy Ride decided to create a Latino branch to work with new artists, calling the branch Joy Ride Latino. They fostered new talent, created a platform and helped showcase their talents to Canadian audiences.Last year, the Joy Ride Latino team released an EP called YNG LGNDZ Season One featuring four Hispanic or Latino artists based in Canada. Happy with its success, they're planning to release another album in collaboration with 12 Canadian artists.'We could use a little bit more credit for what we do'Collado is a Bachata singer born and raised in Mississauga, Ont. The singer got to tour multiple countries and share her Latin Canadian roots. (tdotcam/Collado Productions)Chantel Collado is a Bachata singer born in Mississauga, Ont. She credits her family for making music a big part of her life, especially her dad, who she says is her biggest influence.""I started performing at a very, very young age,"" Collado told CBC News. Her dad, who is from the Dominican Republic, was a director for multiple bands in Toronto.She began writing her own music by the age of 15 and eventually fell in love with Bachata. She thought the music genre from the Dominican Republic would be the best way to explore her roots.""I grew up in a household with my parents being Latinos, speaking Spanish, I would almost say that's my first language,"" said Collado.In her music videos, Collado tries to mix Canadian and Latin American cultures. In Congelados, she shows her audience what a winter in Ontario can be like.But like many others in the industry, she believes there are few opportunities for Latin singers in Canada.""I do feel like we could use a little bit more credit for what we do. We're almost forced to leave our country and take our music elsewhere,"" Collado said. ""I feel like there could be some work there [in Canada].""The changing Latin music scene in CanadaDebi Nova, Alex Cuba, and Raquel Sofía perform onstage during the 21st Annual Latin Grammy Awards held in Miami in 2020. (Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images)The Latin Canadian music scene has been growing, and Alex Puentes — better known by the stage name Alex Cuba — has benefitted from it, scoring wins and nominations at the Grammys, Latin Grammys and Juno Awards. Cuba won his first Grammy on Sunday and is also nominated for World Music Album at the 2022 Junos in May.The singer is grateful people are more familiar with Latin culture today, ""even though it's only one kind of Latin music,"" he said. He remembers seeing a shift in the genre when he was sitting at a Tim Hortons and the song Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Justin Bieber came on.""I never dreamed that I was going to be at Tim Hortons and listen to Latin music,"" said the Grammy nominee. ""Despacito broke through so many barriers.""But that doesn't mean more visibility for Latin artists. Cuba has asked the Juno Awards to introduce a Latin music category and said he receives the same answer: ""There is not enough music yet.""""We have fought really, really hard to get it to where it is today.""CBC News contacted the Juno Awards about Cuba's comment, but has not yet received a response.Advice to artists: Don't give upMontreal based music producer Kiko, part of the duo Los Audio Kimikos, said it has been a ""long and tedious battle"" to find recognition in Canada. But he is hopeful for a future of more Latin-inspired music.His advice to young artists?""Not to give up and not to be shy of where you're from ... just be grateful and show off your culture.""Kiko recalls his passion for music from when he was around 13, making beats at home as a hobby. Today, working as a producer, Kiko says determined new Latin artists in Canada can also make their marks.It's ""a lot of hard work and dedication, blood, sweat and tears … but it pays off.""";"""It's all about creating a movement here in Canada, and Quebec, to make sure that everybody is aware that the Latino music and the Latino scene is very powerful right now.""Last year, the Joy Ride Latino team released an EP called YNG LGNDZ Season One featuring four Hispanic or Latino artists based in Canada.The changing Latin music scene in CanadaDebi Nova, Alex Cuba, and Raquel Sofía perform onstage during the 21st Annual Latin Grammy Awards held in Miami in 2020.""I never dreamed that I was going to be at Tim Hortons and listen to Latin music,"" said the Grammy nominee.Today, working as a producer, Kiko says determined new Latin artists in Canada can also make their marks.";['music', 'canada', 'work', 'support', 'say', 'latino', 'joy', 'singer', 'musicians', 'creating', 'cruzito', 'isnt', 'ride', 'space', 'scene', 'latin', 'artists'];0.2516756600207305;positive
CBC;After months in lockdown, JP Saxe is finally 'getting the dream back';"JP Saxe released ""If the World was Ending,"" his duet with Julia Michaels, in October 2019. In mere months, the song started to gain a lot of attention, even landing the Canadian singer-songwriter on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.""Around that time, it felt like my dreams were beginning to come true,"" Saxe tells CBC Music in the latest episode of COVID Diaries. ""I was about to do my first headline tour, and I was just loving every bit of my life.""But that first little spark of success that Saxe had been striving for was suddenly in danger of fizzling out as COVID-19 halted tours, and musicians were stuck at home searching for new ways to be creative and connect with fans. And in an unexpected turn, Saxe's apocalyptic anthem began resonating with more people, bumping streams up into the millions, spawning covers by Shawn Mendes, Tate McRae and Johnny Orlando, and earning Saxe and Michaels (his real-life girlfriend) a Grammy nomination for song of the year.In Episode 4 of COVID Diaries, CBC Music catches up with Saxe as he finally embarks on his headlining tour across Canada in October 2021 to discuss his unique rise to fame over the past two years.";"JP Saxe released ""If the World was Ending,"" his duet with Julia Michaels, in October 2019.In mere months, the song started to gain a lot of attention, even landing the Canadian singer-songwriter on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.""Around that time, it felt like my dreams were beginning to come true,"" Saxe tells CBC Music in the latest episode of COVID Diaries.""I was about to do my first headline tour, and I was just loving every bit of my life.""In Episode 4 of COVID Diaries, CBC Music catches up with Saxe as he finally embarks on his headlining tour across Canada in October 2021 to discuss his unique rise to fame over the past two years.";['music', 'saxe', 'michaels', 'covid', 'jp', 'tour', 'diaries', 'yearin', 'finally', 'lockdown', 'getting', 'song', 'months', 'cbc', 'dream', 'episode'];0.18274147727272727;positive

CBC;Justin Bieber, The Weeknd and more Canadian nominations to know ahead of the Grammys;It'll be Viva Las Vegas for Canadian musicians on Sunday as the Grammy Awards get underway in the gambling capital of the world.COVID-19 safety precautions and scheduling conflicts forced the biggest night in music to relocate to the Las Vegas Strip, where an array of homegrown contenders are in the running for golden gramophones. But not everyone plans to show up in person for the big night, which will take place indoors at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.Justin Bieber leads the Canadians with eight nominations, but his attendance is still unconfirmed and he's not listed among the performers. Bieber has a mixed relationship with awards events, often choosing to skip the festivities, as he did the 2021 Grammys.Peterborough, Ont., record producer Greg Wells, who's up for best musical theatre album and best compilation soundtrack for visual media, says he's staying home out of an abundance of caution as the pandemic continues.Dan Snaith, better known by his stage name Caribou, also won't be in attendance if he wins best dance/electronic recording for his album You Can Do It.Most of the 86 Grammy categories, including many of the awards with Canadian nominees, will be handed out at a pre-telecast ceremony hosted by LeVar Burton.Here are five things to watch for on Sunday:Bieber feverJustin Bieber performs at a concert in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, in December 2021. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil)If Justin Bieber doesn't show, his absence could be felt throughout Grammys night. Many of his eight nominations are in marquee categories announced on the broadcast.Bieber's chart-topper Peaches, which he performs with Toronto's Daniel Caesar, is up for both record and song of the year, while Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe) is nominated for album of the year and best pop vocal album.The Stratford, Ont., native is also in contention for best pop solo performance for Anyone and best pop duo for his work alongside Benny Blanco on Lonely.Peaches juiced two more nods in the best R&B performance and best music video categories. The tally is by far the most nods Bieber has received in a single year, and adds to his two Grammy wins and 22 nominations.More than AbelThe Weeknd accepts the song of the year award for Blinding Lights at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards on May 27, 2021. ( Kevin Winter/Getty Images)Another Canadian unlikely to grace the night is the Weeknd, who pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys when he was shut out from the nominations last year.It's surprising, then, that the Toronto pop superstar, born Abel Tesfaye, appears three times among the list of 2022 nominees. But don't necessarily blame the singer for breaking his own promise — all of his nods come from appearances on other artists' work.He's named alongside Lil Baby on Kanye West's Hurricane, which is up for best melodic rap performance, and for his vocal contributions to Doja Cat's deluxe edition of Planet Her and West's Donda, both up for album of the year.No DrakeDrake, seen in Long Beach, Calif., in October 2021, withdrew his name from two Grammy categories. (Amy Sussman/Getty Images)The Toronto rapper's on-again, off-again relationship with the Recording Academy is officially off again after he withdrew his name from two Grammy categories once he was already announced as a nominee last November.Drake's Certified Lover Boy was originally up for best rap album, while his song Way 2 Sexy, featuring Future and Young Thug, was in the running for best rap performance. Those two categories now have one fewer nominee, since organizers opted not to replace Drake's name.Before an artist is nominated, their record label or another representative must submit their work for consideration. Drake has given no explanation for his decision to pull out.Quiet stormMontreal's Allison Russell, seen in New York earlier this month, is being recognized for her work in the Americana category. (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)With three Grammy nominations for her debut album, Outside Child, Montreal's Allison Russell is one to watch.The singer-songwriter's deeply personal project draws on childhood abuse and is recognized in the best Americana album category. The song Nightflyer is in contention for best American roots performance and best American roots song.Aside from her potential wins, Russell will take the stage to perform on the Grammys' pre-telecast that streams live on Grammy.com.

CBC;Russian pianist Trifonov to play Montreal concert after fellow Russian Malofeev's performance cancelled;"Three weeks after it cancelled piano performances by Russian virtuoso Alexander Malofeev due to the war in Ukraine, the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (OSM) says it's going ahead with a program featuring another Russian pianist, Daniil Trifonov.Trifonov will join the OSM at the Maison Symphonique on April 20 and 21 for a concert featuring music from French and Russian composers.The OSM had previously cancelled three performances by Malofeev, which had been set to take place in March, saying it ""would be inappropriate"" for the Russian artist to perform that week, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The Montreal symphony's decision came just days after a planned concert by the 20-year-old prodigy in Vancouver had also been cancelled.The Canada Council for the Arts also announced on March 4 that it was ceasing funding to ""all activity involving the participation of Russian or Belarusian artists or arts organizations."" It later clarified that these measures were temporary and acknowledged that ""many Russian artists do not support the decisions of their government.""Alexander Malofeev, 20, seen here playing in Moscow on Jan. 23, saw his concerts in Vancouver and Montreal cancelled, following the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Alexander Malofeev/Facebook)In a Facebook post Thursday, the Montreal symphony orchestra said the decision to go ahead with Trifonov's concerts came after ""careful consideration,"" adding that ""the entire OSM family wishes to renew its full and sincere support for the Ukrainian people.""""We have heard comments from a large number of individuals from many different backgrounds who, in good faith and despite the horrors of war, hope that music will continue to be a vehicle for peace and solidarity between nations,"" the statement read.""It is not our intention to place the burden of war on artists who have nothing to do with the atrocities being committed in Ukraine.""Pascale Ouimet, spokesperson for the OSM, said Friday the decision to cancel Malofeev's concerts had been a ""heartbreaking"" one that was made ""while a serious humanitarian crisis was unfolding in real time before our eyes.""Ouimet confirmed that Malofeev ""is invited and will return with the OSM,"" with dates to be announced in the future.Trifonov, 31, a piano virtuoso and a past winner of the prestigious International Tchaikovsky Competition, posted on Instagram on Feb 25, at the outset of the Russian invasion, saying it was ""heartbreaking to witness what has been happening.""""I wish I could bring solace and peace in these difficult times,"" he wrote.The OSM said it hopes that Trifonov's presence ""will help spread a message of peace, and that music will speak louder than weapons.""";"Three weeks after it cancelled piano performances by Russian virtuoso Alexander Malofeev due to the war in Ukraine, the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (OSM) says it's going ahead with a program featuring another Russian pianist, Daniil Trifonov.Trifonov will join the OSM at the Maison Symphonique on April 20 and 21 for a concert featuring music from French and Russian composers.The Montreal symphony's decision came just days after a planned concert by the 20-year-old prodigy in Vancouver had also been cancelled.Alexander Malofeev, 20, seen here playing in Moscow on Jan. 23, saw his concerts in Vancouver and Montreal cancelled, following the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Trifonov, 31, a piano virtuoso and a past winner of the prestigious International Tchaikovsky Competition, posted on Instagram on Feb 25, at the outset of the Russian invasion, saying it was ""heartbreaking to witness what has been happening.""";['music', 'performance', 'russian', 'concerts', 'malofeevs', 'cancelled', 'malofeev', 'trifonov', 'play', 'montreal', 'peace', 'fellow', 'concert', 'osm', 'invasion', 'war', 'pianist', 'decision'];0.06514778325123152;neutral
CBC;How Georgia Harmer transforms her memories into music;"For Georgia Harmer, no detail is too small.The Toronto singer-songwriter's music is full of keen observations, whether she's describing the crispness of the air or trying to find words to illustrate those magical, unspoken moments between two people. ""Memories can only capture so much,"" she explains. ""With music, you can literally materialize how something felt.""An example of this is on ""Talamanca,"" the opening number of her upcoming debut album, Stay in Touch (out April 22 via Arts & Crafts). Over an acoustic guitar and soft drum beat, Harmer paints a vivid picture of a day she spent in Costa Rica — while she was on the road for her previous job, singing backup for Canadian pop star Alessia Cara — waiting for the sun to rise as she sat on a rooftop with a friend: ""Speaking without words/ languages of seeing and being seen/ the feelings in the air/ a silence we both can read.""Harmer's songwriting comes fully formed on Stay in Touch, but it's a skill that's been developing for years thanks to a lifetime of being in close proximity to other musicians. If that last name feels familiar, it's because Georgia is the niece of renowned singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer, but Georgia's parents are also both musicians (her mother wasn't a full-time musician, but her father has been touring her whole life). ""He's always just handed me guitars or been like, 'Here's a drum set,'"" she says, of her father. By the time she was nine or 10 years old, she was performing gigs around Toronto with a band (made up of three sets of young siblings) called I Eat Kidz.But even though she grew up in the world of music, Harmer didn't consider pursuing a career in music until she was at McGill University studying general arts. ""They don't really tell you that you can be a songwriter,"" she notes, referring to civics classes and career tests that shy away from encouraging kids to become artists. ""I was just always wanting to write songs all the time  that's the only way that I've ever been able to process my emotions in a productive way."" So, she dropped out.While Harmer notes her time touring with Cara as another detour similar to attending McGill, she is grateful for the valuable lessons that experience taught her. ""It gave me an opportunity to see behind the curtain of what the music industry can be like and the level you can get to, and I feel like that was super educational for me and taught me about the way that I wanted my career to play out.""Now finally doing things on her own terms as a solo artist, Harmer has brought all her influences into one place, from the rock her parents played when she was growing up to the R&B and soul she listened to as a teenager. Most notably, though, she draws from the folk artists she admires such as Joni Mitchell, the Weather Station and Big Thief. And those memories and moments she's collected and reflected on over the years spill into her work, both in quiet, intimate songs like ""Know You Forever,"" a sparse track that mostly features Harmer and a guitar, or bigger bursts like ""All in my Mind"" or ""Top Down,"" which includes a fuller band setup. No matter the sound, Harmer's words are front and centre, transforming life's minutiae into gorgeous, moving melodies.As Harmer explains it: ""I'm looking for what is happening under the surface of a moment.""On Harmer's debut single, ""Headrush,"" she mourns a moment that has passed while she's still in it. It's a message to herself and to her listeners to be more in the moment, to appreciate what's happening so you're not constantly looking back to analyze what happened.""I was so aware of how temporary that day was, and generally that time of my life,"" she says, of that perfect summer day she captures in the song. When asked how she tries to stay more in the moment nowadays, she laughs and says she should take her own advice more often, but also notes that when you can be both aware and appreciative of a moment, it can be ""kind of beautiful and amazing.""""I have always struggled with, 'How do we keep this? How do we stay in touch?'"" she continues. ""That's literally where the title of my record comes from. I'm still looking for the answer.""";"For Georgia Harmer, no detail is too small.An example of this is on ""Talamanca,"" the opening number of her upcoming debut album, Stay in Touch (out April 22 via Arts & Crafts).But even though she grew up in the world of music, Harmer didn't consider pursuing a career in music until she was at McGill University studying general arts.While Harmer notes her time touring with Cara as another detour similar to attending McGill, she is grateful for the valuable lessons that experience taught her.As Harmer explains it: ""I'm looking for what is happening under the surface of a moment.""";['music', 'memories', 'way', 'transforms', 'stay', 'georgia', 'moment', 'harmer', 'thats', 'shes', 'words', 'notes', 'touch'];0.22527189888301;positive
CBC;Testosterone therapy may bring you closer to your gender identity, but how will it affect your singing voice?;"""To think that women sing high and men sing low is just such a mischaracterization,"" says Ari Agha during the opening minute of Voice Trans*formed, a new short film by Leah Borts-Kuperman and Maria Sarrouh, streaming above.Agha is a sociologist, activist and advocate for transgender singers. They're also the creator and researcher behind the Key of T Project, which studies transgender singing-voice transition through testosterone therapy, using their own experience as a case study.""The lack of systematic information on transgender voice transitions makes the decision to start testosterone especially difficult for transgender singers,"" explains the Key of T's mission statement. ""They can either take testosterone to transition, but risk losing functional use of their voice, or continue living with a body that does not align with their gender.""It's a dilemma that Asher MacLaren also faced. The research published by the Key of T Project helped MacLaren make an informed decision about taking testosterone. ""Most of my fears did come true, at least temporarily,"" admits the Vancouver singer in Voice Trans*formed.""I lost my voice for quite a while, but I've gained a new one,"" he continues. ""I have what I wanted, which is a tenor range, and one that works, albeit not as well as my old range worked, but I trained that [range] for years and I've probably trained this voice for six months.""The video also includes clips from voice lessons and an explanation of the physiological changes that occur to the larynx and vocal chords during testosterone therapy.""With transmasculine people, I find they're trying to adapt to the newfound chest resonance,"" explains Stephanie Weiss, assistant professor of voice at Arizona State University. ""Their voice sits a little bit lower, and if they were singers before [transitioning], they probably trained using a higher instrument.""MacLaren likens the process to breaking in a new car.

CBC;Destroyer's melancholic disco, and 4 other songs you need to hear this week;"Here at CBC Music, we're always on high alert for the best new songs by Canadian artists.This week, we're listening to new tracks from:Alexandra Stréliski.Destroyer.Pierre Kwenders.Missy D.New City.Scroll down to find out why you should listen, too.What new Canadian tunes are you currently obsessed with? Share them with us on Twitter @CBCMusic.Tune into CBC Music Mornings every Thursday to hear CBC Music's Jess Huddleston and Saroja Coehlo reveal which of these tracks is the standout new Canadian song.'Plus tôt' (string quartet version), Alexandra StréliskiAlexandra Stréliski's ""Plus tôt,"" which originally aired on the Amy Adams-led HBO drama Sharp Objects, is a light, buoyant piano piece, something the Montreal composer likened to a time of innocence before a life-changing event. ""It's the beginning of the trip,"" she said in her 2018 press material. Her new version of ""Plus tôt,"" recorded with a string quartet, is the flip side: the introspective, heavier time that comes when you have to reckon with what's been altered. Written in collaboration with Flore Laurentienne, the project helmed by fellow Quebecer Mathieu David Gagnon (and brother to Polaris shortlisted songwriter Klô Pelgag), the string quartet version of ""Plus tôt"" has a slowed tempo and clocks in at nearly a minute longer than the original, leaving space for more complicated feelings than its predecessor. It's a perfect pairing with the other single Stréliski released last week, an interpretation of French composer Erik Satie's Gnossienne No. 1, and for fans of Sharp Objects, this new version of ""Plus tôt"" is a mood-fitting track after those final moments. — Holly Gordon'It Takes a Thief,' DestroyerThe singles leading up to the release of Destroyer's 13th album, Labyrinthitis, have all given listeners a glimpse into the artist's keen brand of melancholic disco, from the rhythm guitars on ""Eat the Wine, Drink the Bread"" to the sparkling opus of ""June."" But perhaps the most uptempo and bright example of disco on the album is ""It Takes a Thief,"" a song that's drenched in handclaps, strings flourishes, and bursts of horns — all that's missing is perhaps even more cowbell. While frontman Dan Bejar's songwriting is fairly amorphous throughout the album, ""It Takes a Thief"" is so loose that Bejar starts scatting in its climax, clouding any signs of gloom (for example, punch lines like, ""Oh, well, the band don't need a name/ But the band needs a hope in hell,"") under an inescapably joyous soundscape. Laughing, dancing, crying — Destroyer's music invites you to do a bit of everything. — Melody Lau'Kilimanjaro,' Pierre KwendersIf Pierre Kwenders' upcoming album, José Louis and the Paradox of Love, is an exploration of love in all its facets, ""Kilimanjaro"" is the moment where he contemplates sexual desire. For many, climbing the dormant volcano in Tanzania represents a journey to the roof of Africa, but it can also be seen as a metaphor for self-discovery. Kwenders pushes that metaphor further, turning that climb into a pursuit of pleasure. The song opens with a saxophone lick that engulfs the senses with raw sensuality, mimicking the movement of slowly gyrating hips. Then, the Congolese rumba drums kick in and it becomes an exalted celebration. Kwenders took the Epher Heilland-directed video as an opportunity to show his reverence for African and Black American greats: ""Sometimes I dream of being from the glorious time of Fela or dancing like Tshala Muana, or being the handsome Orfeu Negro, the one that every girl dreams of,"" he said in a press release. With his face superimposed over a laundry list of icons like Fela Kuti, James Brown, Prince, Grace Jones and Jimmy Hendrix, he gets to realize that dream, if fleetingly. — Kelsey Adams'Case Départ,' Missy DThis is the sound of an artist who's feeling themself, and it's glorious. It's the syncopated strut of the brass funk backbeat, the warm nostalgia of golden age hip-hop nods and namedrops, and the lush velvet flow of Missy D singing and rapping. ""Case Départ"" is the title track off her new album, and in many ways it's a return to form. It's Missy D's first francophone album, even though she started rapping in French when she was just 11 years old. Case Départ will ""touch on childhood, nostalgia, grief, homesickness, longing for others through the pandemic, and pushing through the overthinking moments and celebrating the little steps you make,"" Missy D promises in the press release. ""That forward motion. This is just the beginning of something special."" D'accord, Missy D, c'est très spécial. — Andrea Warner'Livin' for the Weekend,' New CityWorking from home during the COVID-19 pandemic had its benefits, but it also blurred the line between our professional and personal lives. Toronto pop trio New City aims to restore that balance on ""Livin' for the Weekend,"" a highlight from Live my Life, the group's debut full-length, released on March 25. Setting the song in sunny E-flat major, they establish a warm, irresistible Friday-at-5 p.m. feeling. ""It's Friday night and I got no plans/ Got a feeling we'll go out, grab a drink, and I'll pretend I can dance,"" goes the opening verse, over straightforward synth-and-drum accompaniment. Production expands with jangly guitars and vocal layers for the chorus — ""Ooh, we've been living for the weekend/ Getting high as hell, hanging with my best friends"" — to capture the euphoria of knowing the next 48 hours are all yours. New City plays four Ontario cities plus Montreal on tour with Neon Dreams and Casey Lowry at the end of May. — Robert Rowat";"Here at CBC Music, we're always on high alert for the best new songs by Canadian artists.'Plus tôt' (string quartet version), Alexandra StréliskiAlexandra Stréliski's ""Plus tôt,"" which originally aired on the Amy Adams-led HBO drama Sharp Objects, is a light, buoyant piano piece, something the Montreal composer likened to a time of innocence before a life-changing event.Her new version of ""Plus tôt,"" recorded with a string quartet, is the flip side: the introspective, heavier time that comes when you have to reckon with what's been altered.It's a perfect pairing with the other single Stréliski released last week, an interpretation of French composer Erik Satie's Gnossienne No.1, and for fans of Sharp Objects, this new version of ""Plus tôt"" is a mood-fitting track after those final moments.";['melancholic', 'destroyers', 'week', 'disco', 'songs', 'album', 'plus', 'thief', 'string', 'need', 'version', 'takes', 'song', 'weekend', 'tôt', 'hear', 'missy'];0.16051883704057612;positive

Her second album, One Wish, was certified platinum and produced two No. 1 singles, ""We Can't be Friends"" and ""Nobody's Supposed to be Here,"" the latter of which held the record for the longest running No. 1 R&B single of all time. Cox is a three-time Juno Award winner, a two-time Soul Train Award winner, and also an accomplished actor, starring in projects such as Love Come Down, First Wives Club and last year's HBO hit series Station Eleven.Cox has also been recognized and awarded for her work with various social justice initiatives including advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights, support for those living with HIV/AIDS, and the fight for human rights and equality for all.

""But I have the same intense fright and exhilaration and challenge from directing that I did from when I first started thinking about being an actor.""He said he and his Happy Days co-star Ron Howard — who would go on to win an Academy Award in 2002 for best director for A Beautiful Mind — had discussed the dynamics between casts and crews on productions before Howard became a director.""We would talk about the future, [and] how he would direct me — which he did — [and that] we would act together again,"" said Winkler. ""But we always understood that you never knew who was going to have the solution for you.""The Fonz's enduring legacyWinkler went on to talk about one of the lasting emblems of his time as an actor: the leather jacket his character wore in Happy Days.By then, one of the leather jackets the Fonz had worn had been donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Another met a different fate.""There is one jacket that we ripped out the lining for when I jumped the shark on the motorcycle — no, on the water skis,"" said Winkler.

""It's pretty surreal. He's one of the best players to ever play.""It's extremely humbling.""WATCH l Matthews scores pair as Leafs clinch playoff berth:Auston Matthews scores two goals to help Leafs clinch a playoff berth Duration 1:23 Auston Matthews scored his league-leading 57th and 58th goals to lift Toronto over Montreal 3-2. 1:23Matthews extended his point streak to 16 games (21 goals, 10 assists) as the Leafs clinched a playoff spot for the sixth straight season and reached 100 points in the standings with 10 contests left on the schedule.""He's doing something special right now,"" said defenceman Morgan Rielly, Toronto's longest serving player. ""To be a part of it is a lot of fun.""John Tavares also scored for the Leafs (47-19-6), who got 24 saves from Erik Kallgren.Mitch Marner — Matthews' partner in crime on the top line — set up his teammate's first goal to extend his point streak to 13 contests (eight goals, 20 assists).Cole Caufield and Joel Edmundson replied for Montreal (20-41-11). Jake Allen stopped the first 14 shots he faced before leaving with an apparent leg injury as he stretched in vain for Matthews' first. Sam Montembeault made 23 stops the rest of the way.Matthews set Toronto's single-season record for goals when he scored for the 55th and 56th time in 2021-22 in Thursday's 4-3 overtime victory in Dallas.'Just a really, really cool day'Rick Vaive, who held the franchise mark of 54 goals in a campaign for 40 years, was on hand at Scotiabank Arena earlier Saturday to offer his personal congratulations.""He had some really nice words,"" Matthews said. ""Guys like him that have come before us really paved the way and showed what it really means to be a Toronto Maple Leaf.""Just a really, really cool day.""Matthews is now on pace for 67 goals in his 77-game season — he missed three contests with a wrist injury and two via suspension — and could become the first player to score 65 since Alex Ovechkin in 2007-08.""It's very special to be part of this team and to be able to watch him put up the amount of goals he's done this year,"" Kallgren said.""It's unreal.""Steven Stamkos was the last NHLer to get to 60 when he reached the milestone in 2011-12.Auston Matthews has 43 even-strength goals in 2021-22, eclipsing Frank Mahovlich (41 in 1960-61) for the most in a single season in <a href=""https://twitter.com/MapleLeafs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@MapleLeafs</a> history.<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHLStats?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHLStats</a>: <a href=""https://t.co/Ue8Wg4hl36"">https://t.co/Ue8Wg4hl36</a> <a href=""https://t.co/a5CCouSsEG"">pic.twitter.com/a5CCouSsEG</a> —@PR_NHLMatthews was surprised to be honoured during Saturday's first TV timeout for eclipsing Vaive. He rose to his skates on the bench, tapped his chest and acknowledged to the adoring crowd at Scotiabank Area.The No. 1 pick at the 2016 NHL draft then got raucous ""M-V-P!"" chants as the night wore on following his offensive outburst.""You get chills in your bones,"" Matthews said with a grin. ""It's definitely a cool feeling. This is a special place to play.""We're trying to build towards something special here.""The rebuilding Canadiens, who downed the Leafs in their last two meetings at the Bell Centre, weathered an early barrage before Matthews struck at 13:32 of the first after Toronto defenceman Mark Giordano's centering pass off the rush ticked off Edmundson. Allen contorted his body to make the initial save, but the puck fell kindly for Matthews to bury his 50th in 50 games to match Lemieux.'I couldn't be happier for him'""It's fun to see it front-row and be his linemate and be his friend,"" said winger Michael Bunting, the third member of the Leafs' top trio. ""I couldn't be happier for him. He's such a good guy off the ice and he's such an exceptional player.""Montembault replaced the ailing Allen, but could do nothing on the first shot he faced when Matthews wired his 58th under the netminder's glove moments later.""It's never easy to come in cold,"" said the netminder. ""I might have been better off getting the first one from someone other than Matthews.""William Nylander then hit the post on a Toronto power play before Kallgren had to stop Nick Suzuki's short-handed chance and a Caufield breakaway out of the penalty box.""Kally made some really big saves when we had little hiccups,"" Matthews said.Montembault came up with a couple nice stops to keep the score at 2-0 early in the second before Montreal got on the board. Caufield made an incredible play to keep the puck in at the Leafs' blue line to extend a sequence that eventually saw Edmundson score his second at 5:58.Tavares, whose team is in a battle for Atlantic Division playoff positioning, scored his 26th at 8:07 on a shot that went in off Canadiens defenceman Jordan Harris to make it 3-1.But Montreal, which upset Toronto in the first round of last season's playoff to kickstart an improbable run to the Stanley Cup final, got back within one with 1:57 left in the period when Caufield buried his 18th.The Leafs' top-ranked power play got a 5-on-3 opportunity for 1:44 with under 10 minutes to go in regulation, but couldn't connect before the visitors also had a late, fruitless man advantage that was extended to a 6-on-4 with Montembeault on the bench for an extra attacker.But the night, once again, belonged to Matthews.""He's clearly not satisfied,"" Keefe said.

CBC;Peter Mansbridge: The Arctic is a land of opportunity for Canada but we can't leave Northern residents behind;"I have been travelling to the High Arctic for more than 50 years. I took my latest trip, another exhilarating voyage, through parts of the Northwest Passage in the fall of 2021 while filming the CBC Docs original Arctic Blue with Peter Mansbridge.I remember my first time inside the Arctic Circle in the late '60s. I flew over Grise Fiord just 15 years after Canada, as a nation, had first relocated a number of Inuit families from northern Quebec to what was then a barren strip of land in the High Arctic and start new communities.Why did we do it? Basically, for the Inuit to act as human flagpoles in an attempt to underline Canada's ownership of the Arctic archipelago, even though most of the lands were uninhabited.Bureaucrats said the relocations were intended to help the Inuit, who were finding it difficult to survive as subsistence hunters. But guess who wasn't sitting around the table when that decision was made? That's right. The Inuit.Against their will, families were shipped to the far North to act as 'human flagpoles' | Arctic Blue with Peter Mansbridge Duration 2:07 To maintain its sovereignty over the North, Canada shipped families North, to occupy the territory. The families were told they could leave when they wanted, but they couldn't and their descendants remain there to this day. 2:07They were fed a line of spin about where they were going and the resources it offered, and then moved by sealift to Ellesmere Island with a promise that they could leave if they didn't like it. They didn't like it , but no one listened, and they're still there today.I tell you that story because history is important — and it's especially relevant in light of what's at play in the Arctic right now.A changing Arctic means opportunity and exploitationClimate change makes everything different. There are challenges for sure, but there are also opportunities.In the Arctic, ice is melting — and fast — and the waterways are opening up. Mineral exploration is increasing, and the unrealized potential of the Northwest Passage as a transportation thoroughfare is front and centre. Many countries are ready to put their stake in the still frozen, but increasingly lucrative, tundra.Take a look at a globe from the top. Imagine all that ice around the North Pole vanishing, because that's what scientists around the world are convinced will be the case during Arctic summers long before the end of this century.Now, look at the number of countries that can claim varying degrees of ownership when those waters touch their coastlines. It's not just Canada. Add the United States, Denmark, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland.Debates will not just be about security, they'll also be about the potential billions in natural resources and hundreds of thousands of new jobs that come with them — in a region desperate for both. And Canada is lagging behind the advancements made by the other Arctic nations in preparation for the journey toward those riches.But this is a complicated story, as I saw and heard throughout the parts of the Arctic our documentary crew visited.A conversation of contradictionsThere's a justified desire to use any financial gains from local resources to improve basic infrastructure in the communities nearby and a plea from young people, whose numbers are increasing rapidly, for jobs so they can stay in the North.Joshua Arreak is the mayor of Pond Inlet. In the CBC Docs Special Arctic Blue, he said he sees the benefits his community could reap from expansion of a nearby mine but understands why the idea of further development is meeting resistance. (CBC Docs/Arctic Blue)But there's also a hope — in some cases, from the same people — to keep their traditional way of life which, for centuries, has depended on fishing and hunting. The conversation is fraught with contradiction and is playing out across the Arctic.In Pond Inlet, mayor Joshua Arreak sees the benefits his community could reap from expansion of a nearby mine but understands why the idea of further development is meeting resistance.""Our mammals and land animals have been affected,"" he tells me in Arctic Blue. ""And we like country food — we harvest that every year.""A question of sovereigntyNo one knows the challenge in Canada's North better than Governor General Mary Simon. ""We need development in the North, but at the same time, we shouldn't have to forsake our own culture and identity through the same process. So there has to be a balance,"" she says in the documentary.Simon has been an advocate for Inuit rights and Indigenous sovereignty for decades and oversaw the international push by Inuit from across the Arctic nations to make their case known to the world. She did that effectively in Canada by knocking heads at times with a certain Pierre Elliott Trudeau in the early '80s.Governor General of Canada Mary Simon spoke to Peter Mansbridge about Indigenous sovereignty in the CBC Docs Special, Arctic Blue. (CBC/Arctic Blue)Today, after being selected by Trudeau's son, she is the sovereign's representative in Canada — with national sovereignty high on the list of her priorities.It may seem counterintuitive, but as she told me during our sit-down in the documentary, ""because there's so many changes taking place now, [there] might be a situation where you see a lot of control taken by nation states and the communities being left behind.""My most recent time in the Arctic was spent on the latest ""flagpole"" of our sovereignty and the Canadian navy's newest warship, the HMCS Harry DeWolf, as it travelled to Grise Fiord, Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay.Eventually, there will be five similar vessels, costing a total of $4.1 billion.Sure, they'll hunt for those foreign submarines Canada knows have been through the Passage, and they'll watch out for commercial vessels breaking environmental rules. But perhaps more importantly, they'll be making their way through our waters, visiting communities — people who have, at times, been the most neglected Canadians — and trying to establish with them that they won't be left behind this time.As the HMCS Harry DeWolf's captain, Corey Gleason, told me, with emotion clear in his voice as he referred back to the forced relocations, Canada has a lot to make up for: ""We've got a terrible history … They separated families, and that's not OK.Watch Arctic Blue with Peter Mansbridge.";"I took my latest trip, another exhilarating voyage, through parts of the Northwest Passage in the fall of 2021 while filming the CBC Docs original Arctic Blue with Peter Mansbridge.Against their will, families were shipped to the far North to act as 'human flagpoles' | Arctic Blue with Peter Mansbridge Duration 2:07 To maintain its sovereignty over the North, Canada shipped families North, to occupy the territory.And Canada is lagging behind the advancements made by the other Arctic nations in preparation for the journey toward those riches.""Our mammals and land animals have been affected,"" he tells me in Arctic Blue.Governor General of Canada Mary Simon spoke to Peter Mansbridge about Indigenous sovereignty in the CBC Docs Special, Arctic Blue.";['peter', 'canada', 'sovereignty', 'land', 'northern', 'mansbridge', 'arctic', 'inuit', 'blue', 'north', 'theyll', 'cant', 'residents', 'leave', 'families', 'opportunity', 'cbc'];0.11326737967914438;positive

CBC;Despite laying dozens of charges, RCMP have stopped targeting Canadian accomplices in foreign scam calls;"In the darkness of the early morning of Feb. 13, 2020, several unmarked RCMP vehicles followed Gurinderpreet Dhaliwal into a parking lot in Brampton, Ont., northwest of Toronto. When he stopped, the Mounties made their move, surrounding his vehicle, ordering Dhaliwal out and placing him in handcuffs within seconds.His arrest — and that of his wife, Inderpreet, hours later — was the result of Project Octavia, a concentrated RCMP investigation into telephone scams bilking Canadians out of millions of dollars.Gurinderpreet and Inderpreet Dhaliwal were arrested within hours of each other in 2020 as part of the RCMP’s Project Octavia investigation. Both have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, money laundering and possession of proceeds of crime. (Facebook)A police search of his home would reveal $114,000 in jewelry, plus additional cash, a money-counting machine and other evidence that police say supports their allegations that the couple were key money mules for an overseas crime syndicate, funnelling and laundering money from Canadian victims of scam calls to India-based call-centre operators.The Dhaliwals' trial has been repeatedly delayed. Both have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, money laundering and possession of proceeds of crime. None of the charges against them have been proven in court.Three others scooped up in the task force's broader investigation fled Canada before they could be arrested. Two others were operating from Nepal, but would be arrested if they ever come to Canada. Two took deals avoiding jail time. One was deported. And one has not yet had his trial scheduled.But within a year of the Dhaliwals' arrest, Project Octavia quietly disappeared. The RCMP task force that targeted Canadian accomplices of scam calls was disbanded, even as those calls continue unabated and Canadians' financial losses mount.""In an industry like this that operates with impunity, you are sending a message that Canada doesn't care about this kind of crime,"" said Vanessa Iafolla, a financial crimes researcher at Saint Mary's University in Halifax.Public pressure forced initial RCMP responseThe Mounties formed Project Octavia in October 2018 after a CBC Marketplace investigation revealed how little the RCMP had done to combat the thousands of scam calls harassing Canadians every year, with schemes ranging from Amazon refund scams to impersonating Canada Revenue Agency officials.Ralph Goodale, then-federal public safety minister, promised action. Soon after, the special task force was formed at the Milton, Ont., detachment to find those in Canada providing the critical link between victims here and call centres overseas.""It's essentially a national priority investigation,"" RCMP Insp. Jim Ogden said when the task force was created.But in January 2021, with cases still pending and scam call activity surging, the RCMP eliminated its financial crimes unit in Ontario, which oversaw Project Octavia, redeploying the scam call investigators into other areas.While the Mounties officially say the work will continue inside other pre-existing units, including serious and organized crime teams, a senior RCMP source told Marketplace the investigations have stopped.In 2019, RCMP Insp. Jim Odgen was bullish about Project Octavia’s chances of slowing down phone scams, saying at the time that the RCMP was ‘making a dent’ and ‘doing whatever we can to stop it.' (David Common/CBC)Victims ""will continue to be victimized, they have no recourse,"" the source said by email. CBC is granting confidentiality to the source because they fear professional repercussions for speaking out critically on the decision to effectively end Project Octavia.The source says the RCMP is uniquely placed to work with police in India to tackle the ongoing calls.""These scams are multi-jurisdictional, which makes it impossible for local police departments to actually deal with them effectively,"" the source said.An RCMP spokesperson told Marketplace that its Integrated Market Enforcement Teams (IMET) ""remain a dedicated unit that focuses on frauds or other types of illegal activity in securities markets.""WATCH | Canadians still losing money to scam calls as RCMP shutters task force:RCMP dismantles task force dedicated to stopping phone scammers Duration 1:52 CBC Marketplace has spent five years investigating phone scams, the scammers and the alleged co-ordinators in Canada who funnel money abroad. Now, the team has learned that the RCMP, which once promised it would do everything it could to stop spam calls, has dismantled Project Octavia, its task force dedicated to stopping them. 1:52The RCMP said the unit ""provides expertise in securities law, process and regulation, financial services, regulatory requirements, forensic accounting, corporate investigations, security risk management and capital-market criminal investigations.""However, the source told Marketplace that the unit has nothing to do with investigating phone scams.The decision, says Iafolla, is ""very reactionary. It's fly-by-night.""Vanessa Iafolla is a financial crimes researcher and criminology professor. She says that shutting down Project Octavia is sending the wrong message to would-be scammers. (Dave MacIntosh/CBC)Ending the task force specifically targeting those funnelling money abroad ""just makes Canada a more attractive place for people to engage in these kinds of scams,"" she said.Police say money mules in Canada take in money — and keep a set portion of it — in return for being a conduit back to criminal kingpins. Not all mules are necessarily aware of their role in the scam. Some grew up in India and came to Canada on student visas, or emigrated, and were recruited to become mules before leaving India or once established in Canada.How the scammers get their moneyWhile most of those contacted by scammers do not fall victim to the ruse, a sufficient number do, which makes it a hugely profitable endeavour.Phone scammers, said Iafolla, ""are people who really understand what vulnerabilities other people have and exploit them."" She describes them as ""natural psychologists.""Monique LaFrance, of Gatineau, Que., lost nearly $200,000 in what has become known as the bank investigator scheme.""He presented himself as a security investigator from the Royal Bank, and he told me that my accounts had been compromised,"" she said of the scam call she received in August 2020. ""He asked me if I wanted to help them find the fraudsters and help others.""Monique LaFrance lost nearly $200,000 to the bank investigator scam. (David Common/CBC)The scammer said he would deposit money in her account — and that she was to send that additional money in cash by courier to specific addresses. What she didn't realize was that the scammer had access to her online banking, and was adding money to her savings account by drawing from her line of credit.""It's crazy. It's really crazy. It gets me kind of sick just thinking about it,"" she said.Abhinav Bector told CBC journalists who questioned him in November 2021 that he has nothing to say to his alleged victims. (Facebook)One of those packages was addressed to Abhinav Bector, at his home address, and another package addressed to Abhi B, at a duct-cleaning business where a man of the same name was an employee. The RCMP tracked that package and arrested Bector.He was charged with fraud, money laundering and possession of the proceeds of crime. But in an arrangement that avoided a trial and the possibility of a jail sentence, he pleaded guilty to only the last charge.When approached by CBC journalists in November 2021 and asked if he had anything to say to his victims, some of whom are facing the prospect of losing their homes and life savings, he responded: ""I have nothing. I was not.""Signs on Bector's car suggest he works now as an Uber driver. But at sentencing in September 2021, the court heard he had received a job offer from a Canadian bank. His criminal record will be wiped clean a year after his guilty plea, so the bank making the offer may never know of his criminal past.'I think it's cruel,' alleged victim's daughter saysBoth Gurinderpreet Dhaliwal, arrested by the Mounties in that parking lot in February 2020, and his wife, Inderpreet, are scheduled to face trial. However, the proceedings have been repeatedly delayed and are now not scheduled to begin until the spring of 2023.Inderpreet, left, and Gurinderpreet Dhaliwal on the day of their arrest by RCMP officers. Their trial has yet to begin. (CBC)They continue to live in the Brampton home where police say they found cash connected to scam victims.Court documents allege one of them is Melissa Steele's father. She doesn't want to identify him by name, worrying the scammers will target him again. He has cognitive difficulties and still does not understand what's happened — or the consequences that will change his life.""He got one of those calls saying that he owed tax money and that he was in trouble. He ended up driving to his bank and taking out money.""He has since had to move out of the home. Steele has a message for the couple who allegedly received her father's money, leading to charges.""I would say it's cruel, and how would they feel if somebody treated, you know, their loved ones that way.""Melissa Steele's father lost $69,000 to a phone scam connected to alleged money mules Gurinderpreet and Inderpreet Dhaliwal. (CBC)CBC journalists asked Inderpreet what she would say to people who lost their life savings, some of whom would be expected to testify at trial. She responded: ""No comment.""Her lawyer, Thomas E. Pittman, later contacted CBC to emphasize his client would not make comments before trial. He said the RCMP have wrongly characterized her as a ""player in an international criminal syndicate.""";Gurinderpreet and Inderpreet Dhaliwal were arrested within hours of each other in 2020 as part of the RCMP’s Project Octavia investigation.But within a year of the Dhaliwals' arrest, Project Octavia quietly disappeared.The RCMP task force that targeted Canadian accomplices of scam calls was disbanded, even as those calls continue unabated and Canadians' financial losses mount.CBC is granting confidentiality to the source because they fear professional repercussions for speaking out critically on the decision to effectively end Project Octavia.Police say money mules in Canada take in money — and keep a set portion of it — in return for being a conduit back to criminal kingpins.;['foreign', 'canada', 'say', 'money', 'trial', 'dozens', 'octavia', 'stopped', 'task', 'charges', 'scam', 'canadian', 'project', 'laying', 'scammers', 'despite', 'rcmp', 'targeting'];-0.04704047462199637;neutral

She gained international popularity through her YouTube channel, Superwoman, and went on to executive produce and host NBC's A Little Late with Lilly Singh for two seasons.Her debut book, How to Be a Bawse , won a 2017 Goodreads Choice Award. In the book, the Scarborough, Ont. performer shared her secrets to becoming one of YouTube's biggest stars.Singh's newest book, Be a Triangle , explores how to create inner peace in the face of adversity. From Singh's personal struggles with identity, success and self-doubt, she teaches readers to ""unsubscribe"" from cookie-cutter ideals. Be a Triangle is an uplifting guide to befriending yourself.Here are some of the books and authors Singh has loved reading over the years.Archie ComicsArchie Comics is a comic book series starring Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge. (Penguin Random House)""As a kid, I think the earliest things I read were Archie Comics. I would collect them and I would display them in my room, although I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I thought they were really absurd.""After a long day, my escape was to dive into this absurd world of these characters that I couldn't relate to. And I'll be real, growing up as an Indian kid, I couldn't comprehend the actions of Veronica or [anyone]. I was like, 'Why are your parents not yelling at you?'""It was fascinating for me to dive into this world of seeing these characters act unruly.""The Baby-Sitters Club by Ann M. MartinThe Baby-Sitters Club is a series of juvenile fiction novels by Ann. M. Martin. (CBC, Scholastic Canada Limited)""I think that was the first time I read a story that involved a kid talking about their feelings. She was so descriptive about how she felt about her parents. In the book, her parents get divorced and she talks about that whole process.I think that was the first time I read a story that involved a kid talking about their feelings.""And I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, this is the first time I've ever seen value given to a kid's opinion. She's processing her emotions in a way I've never been introduced to before.' So that was really special for me.""Shopaholic Series by Sophie KinsellaConfessions of a Shopaholic is a book by Sophie Kinsella. (John Swannell, Dial Press)""So my favourite series of all time — I actually got in trouble for reading this in class often. I don't think a teacher should ever get mad at kids for reading, but I used to get in trouble for reading Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic Series.""I was obsessed with the Shopaholic Series in high school. I used to be the classroom leader who had to hold the door open for everyone. And I got in trouble because I would be reading the book while doing those things.""Sophie and I actually follow each other now and she sends me signed books. I fan-girl a little because I love that series so much.""The Four Agreements by Don Miguel RuizThe Four Agreements is a book by Don Miguel Ruiz. (Publishers Group Canada, Aaron Landman)""When I first started therapy in [Los Angeles], my therapist recommended a book to me called The Four Agreements. I guess she listened to me cry for enough sessions and was like, 'You should read The Four Agreements. I think it would really help you.'""The writing style of [The Four Agreements], how simple and short it is, was a big inspiration for my book, Be a Triangle. When I read The Four Agreements, not only did I feel impacted by just the messages, but I love how it was written. The author didn't care about repetition, didn't care if things were redundant, didn't care if sentences were complex. He just said what needed to be said in the way it needed to be said. And so it felt like a friend was giving you a pep talk.The ideas in it are so complex and simple at the same time that someone can use the book as a lens through whatever they're going through in their life.""The ideas in it are so complex and simple at the same time that someone can use the book as a lens through whatever they're going through in their life. I think those are the most powerful books because sometimes I read a book where I'm like, 'This doesn't quite make sense for me and this doesn't quite work with my life.' This is a book where I feel like it could work with everybody's life.""I really love that style of writing and I reference that book a lot to this day. Anytime I feel myself on the brink of sanity, I go back to The Four Agreements.""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) by Mindy KalingActress and comedian Mindy Kaling, pictured above at the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, explores romance, relationships and life in Hollywood in her 2011 book Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? was the first book that made me, as an adult, feel seen.""And I know exactly where I was when I was reading it. I was on a plane and I was so embarrassed because I kept laughing out loud and the person sitting next to me was like, 'Are you crazy?' [Kaling] was so vulnerable. The reason it really struck me is because this is the first time I experienced an adult South Asian woman being vulnerable. She was going into depth about her insecurities in her childhood and I was like, 'Oh my God, I guess we're not so different.'The reason why it really struck me is because this is the first time I experienced an adult South Asian woman being vulnerable.""I feel super seen and I resonate so much with what she's talking about and her delivery is so comedic and awesome and honest. I really fell in love with her style of writing and storytelling. So that book really left an impact on me.""Tell Me How to Be by Neel PatelTell Me How to Be is a novel by Neel Patel. (Macmillan, Bradford Rogne)""I have a very large chip on my shoulder that I'm very honest about, which is I don't think South Asian artists are given enough credit. And I think often when we try to tell our stories in Hollywood on screen, we're told they're not relatable or we're forced to make them really, really broad and not nuanced at all. I have since learned that books are actually so much ahead of what we see on screen when it comes to stories.I have since learned that books are actually so much ahead of what we see on screen when it comes to stories.""I was absolutely blown away by Tell Me How to Be by Neel Patel because, here I am struggling to see South Asian stories on screen, I'm struggling to see South Asian queerness on screen, I'm struggling to see parents that are nuanced because all we see is that strict parent that's very one dimensional. Then I read this book that is so nuanced and complex, and the mother character is not just strict. She has an entire backstory. We understand why she is the way she is and we learn about the secrets she's keeping. And I was like, 'Holy crap, this is so ahead of Hollywood.'""Think Like a Monk by Jay ShettyThink Like a Monk is a self-help book by Jay Shetty (Simon & Schuster, Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)""I will talk about my friend Jay Shetty, who has a book called Think Like a Monk. Aside from being my friend, something I've learned from not only his book, but him as a person, is to be careful who you take advice from, especially when you read self-help.""There's a lot of self-help out there and most of it's on Instagram. I think as humans we tend to gravitate toward people we're comfortable with or we idolize and we get advice from them, even though perhaps their advice is not the best advice for us.When he talks about stories and how he learned the lessons while he was a monk, it's just unlike anything else you'll read because he's not guessing. He's not making it up.​​​​​""Rather, I challenge people to get advice from people who have the experience to give that advice. So, Jay, I feel like, is someone who undeniably has the most amount of experience to give advice. He was a monk for many years. He has studied wisdom and mindfulness in ways that many other people have not. When he talks about stories and how he learned the lessons while he was a monk, it's just unlike anything else you'll read because he's not guessing. He's not making it up.""The Windfall by Diksha BasuThe Windfall is a novel by Diksha Basu. (Penguin Random House, Mikey McCleary)""I'm reading this book called The Windfall and it is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It's about South Asians, but it is about something we don't talk about enough, which is this very elite, competitive nature of well-off South Asians.""So often when you see anything about South Asians, it's usually poverty porn or it's really strict parents or people struggling or trauma or pain. Very seldom do I get to experience stories where South Asians are happy and celebrating and rich and fabulous. So this story just cracks me up because it reminds me so much of some of my aunties and uncles. They're just so competitive with each other, with their saris and their houses and they're trying to show off to each other. It's such an honest take on that behaviour that I've never before been exposed to.""Sometimes I feel like I need to downplay my success or achievements because I don't want to appear egotistical and I don't want to appear stuck up. I want to make sure I'm super humble and relatable, but sometimes that's to my detriment. I've been battling with this idea of, maybe it's good to flex a little bit. I do believe that young girls have to see it to know it's possible.I've been battling with this idea of, maybe it's good to flex a little bit. I do believe that young girls have to see it to know it's possible.""This book has kept me thoroughly entertained and given me the confidence to be that much more honest in my own writing because I don't even know if I could be that honest writing about this behaviour. But this is such an honest take on this community that I really enjoyed.""Lilly Singh's comments have been edited for length and clarity.";"Lilly Singh is an actor, writer and social media creator from Scarborough, Ont.Here are some of the books and authors Singh has loved reading over the years.Archie ComicsArchie Comics is a comic book series starring Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge.So that book really left an impact on me.""(Macmillan, Bradford Rogne)""I have a very large chip on my shoulder that I'm very honest about, which is I don't think South Asian artists are given enough credit.";['comedian', 'read', 'south', 'monk', 'book', 'really', 'books', 'actor', 'singh', 'think', 'series', 'authors', 'inspired', 'lilly', 'advice', 'reading', 'canadian', 'feel'];0.12424851190476192;positive

CBC;Matthews sets single-season franchise scoring record, adds OT winner as Maple Leafs top Stars;"Auston Matthews has the most goals ever in a single season for the Toronto Maple Leafs — and the most in the NHL by an American-born player.Matthews set the franchise record with his 55th goal in regulation Thursday night in Dallas, then scored No. 56 in overtime to break the American record and give the Maple Leafs a 4-3 victory over the Dallas Stars.""This was Auston's night,"" coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""It's much deserved and to finish it with an exclamation point.""Matthews, who had tied Rick Vaive's 40-year-old Maple Leafs mark of 54 goals two games earlier, broke that with his one-timer from the bottom of the circle to the left of goalie Scott Wedgewood after taking a pass back from Mark Giordano on a power play for a 2-1 lead with 1:02 left in the second period.""I just laid it there for him and he just pounded it,"" Giordano said.WATCH | Matthews' scores 55th of season to break franchise record:Leafs' Matthews sets new franchise record for goals in a season Duration 1:21 Auston Matthews scores his 55th goal to establish a new Maple Leafs single season franchise record. 1:21The game-winner winner came when he took a pass from William Nylander and was able to swipe the puck around Wedgewood 2:10 into overtime.The 56th goal surpassed Jimmy Carson and Kevin Stevens, at 55 each, for the most by a U.S.-born skater. It also was Matthews' 52nd career multi-goal game, passing Pat LaFontaine's 51 for the most by a American-born player before age 25.WATCH | Matthews' OT winner lifts Maple Leafs past Stars:Matthews' overtime goal lifts Maple Leafs over Stars Duration 1:33 Auston Matthews' second goal of the game and 56th of the season is the overtime winner as Toronto edges Dallas 4-3. 1:33The 24-year-old from Arizona, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, emphatically pumped his right arm when the puck got through a narrow gap between the goalie and the post on the record-setting 55th goal in the second period.""I just saw the puck go in, and I was just so excited honestly,"" Matthews said. ""There really was not that much else to it. [Giordano] made a really nice pass and he put it right in my wheelhouse, so I just tried to attack the puck and I was able to sneak it in. So it was a lot of stuff going through my mind.""Stars defenceman Miro Heiskanen swiped the puck away, but the record-breaker was retrieved and tossed to the Maple Leafs bench by Mitchell Marner, who grew up in the Toronto area.""It's a hard thing to score a lot of goals in this league, and he's made it look really easy,"" Marner said.Dallas tied it at two with 14:17 left on a laser shot by John Klingberg on a pass from Joe Pavelski. The Maple Leafs went ahead 3-2 on Morgan Rielly's goal just less than five minutes later, but Pavelski tied it again on his 26th goal with 2:23 left in regulation.Tyler Seguin scored his 21st goal for the Stars, who remained in the Western Conference's second wild-card spot through 70 games with 84 points — two points ahead of idle Vegas and with two games still in hand. Wild-card leader Nashville won earlier Thursday and has 86 points in 70 games.Toronto is second in the Atlantic Division with 98 points in 71 games.Matthews tied Vaive at 54 with three goals on Monday night at Tampa Bay, his fourth hat trick this season and eighth goal in a six-game scoring streak. He had three assists but no goals on eight shots at Florida the following night.""A lot of guys when they get 50, they take a breath maybe for a game or two,"" Giordano said.

Got to tip your hat to some guys in the league and the skill that they have. They find him. They give him looks. He's sitting in a goal scorer's position,"" Wedgewood said.

CBC;In Iraq, I met a man who carried a mint plant wherever he went. The reason why fills me with hope every day;A Canadian nurse in war-torn Iraq uncovers the story behind one man's beloved mint plant. Watch Me, Mahmoud and the Mint Plant on CBC Gem.On one of my last days in Iraq, where I had been working for a medical humanitarian organization, my colleague Mahmoud gave me some mint seeds to plant at home in the Yukon.As I sat on the plane back to Canada — with the seeds safely stored in my bag — I began writing down the story of Mahmoud and his own mint plant.In the story, which would go on to be published in the Globe and Mail , I recalled when I saw Mahmoud for the first time. He was walking down the road — carrying a mint plant. Just over a kilometre away from us, the battle of Mosul raged. Gunfire and explosions rang out.I was in west Mosul to set up a trauma stabilization clinic close to the frontline. There, we would stabilize the wounded so they could survive transport to a hospital. Mahmoud became one of the guards for the clinic. He brought his mint plant to work with him every day. And I wondered why.Trish Newport is a Canadian nurse who worked in west Mosul, Iraq. She was there to set up a trauma stabilization clinic close to the frontline. (CBC/Me, Mahmoud and the Mint Plant)Mahmoud and his mint plant were a shining light for us in a very dark period. And when we discovered his reason for carrying the mint plant with him at all times, the story became even more special.For years, Mosul had been controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Mahmoud had home-schooled his children to keep them away from the ISIS curriculum. One of the things he taught them was how to garden. The little mint plant belonged to his youngest daughter.When it was finally safe to leave Mosul, Mahmoud sent his family to a displacement camp, while he stayed behind to guard their home. As his daughter prepared to leave, she asked her father to care for her mint plant until she came home. He assured her that he would. And so he carried it with him, to keep his promise.Mahmoud sent his family to a displacement camp, while he stayed behind to guard their home in Mosul. His youngest daughter asked him to care for her mint plant until she came home. He agreed. (CBC/Me, Mahmoud and the Mint Plant)As I wrote in the story, that plant grounded us. It also gave us hope.But the battle for Mosul was a dark, ugly and horrible war. So when Cat Mills first contacted me about turning the story about Mahmoud and his mint plant into an animated film, I was tempted to say no.This story has stayed with me for so long  when times are extremely difficult, I think of Mahmoud sitting with his mint plant outside the trauma stabilization clinic. Still, I couldn't imagine how an animated film could depict both the beauty of the story and the horrors of the war at the same time.But Cat and her team were able to capture them perfectly. Each time I watch it, I cry with tears of gratitude and of love — and I am filled with hope once again.;He was walking down the road — carrying a mint plant.He brought his mint plant to work with him every day.(CBC/Me, Mahmoud and the Mint Plant)Mahmoud and his mint plant were a shining light for us in a very dark period.And when we discovered his reason for carrying the mint plant with him at all times, the story became even more special.As his daughter prepared to leave, she asked her father to care for her mint plant until she came home.;['reason', 'fills', 'went', 'mint', 'mosul', 'stabilization', 'mahmoud', 'iraq', 'stayed', 'trauma', 'plant', 'hope', 'met', 'youngest', 'clinic', 'man', 'day'];0.062289272030651335;neutral

CBC;Canadian swimmer Taylor Ruck enjoying success on the road to recovery from eating disorder;"Canadian swimmer Taylor Ruck has been beaming every time she has shown up this week at Saanich Commonwealth Place in Victoria, B.C., site of the national trials. Her smile can't be missed, she's full of energy. There's a sparkle in her eyes again.And there is renewed strength in her swimming.Ruck, after competing in four events this week including the 100m, 200m backstroke and the 100m and 200m freestyle events, has qualified for the Canadian world championship team heading to Budapest this summer. This after capturing her first individual NCAA championship win last month in the 200-yard freestyle.""I'm grateful to say I'm happier than ever and grateful to be sharing these experiences with my teammates,"" she told CBC Sports on Sunday, the final night of competition. ""Just happy to be here. Happy to see everybody on deck. Performances were fine. Times weren't really my strong suit here but I feel I did the job. I got on the worlds team.""Ruck, along with thirty-one others, have been named to Canada's team for the world following the week-long trials — 18 women and 14 men. Her Tokyo Olympic teammates Penny Oleksiak, Kylie Masse, Maggie Mac Neil and Summer McIntosh are among medal contenders for Canada at the event, which runs June 18-July 3.It wasn't all that long ago that Ruck, 21, from Kelowna, B.C., had a hard time finding happiness in just about anything she did.She was fully in the grips of an eating disorder and spiraling. It started in 2018, following extraordinary success. Ruck won a record eight medals at the 2018 Commonwealth Games — that was preceded by winning two relay medals at her first Olympics at 16 years old in Rio.Ruck competes in the women's 200m backstroke semifinal during the Tokyo Olympics last July. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)Hard 2 yearsShe was on a path to greatness in the pool. That's when Ruck says she started obsessing over everything she put in her body. From 2018 until 2020 she suffered in silence, quietly wilting away.""There's no energy to do a lot. It impacts your mood. There's a spiral that happens. I lost myself personally for a while,"" Ruck said. ""I hope anyone going through this has help and I pray for them and hope the best for them that they find support.""Last year, during the national trials ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Ruck was underperforming. By that point she was seeking help and somewhat on a path to recovery. But after years of depletion, she was still not at full strength.""It was definitely a hard two years. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be the best,"" she said.In Tokyo, Ruck only swam in the preliminary heats for the Canadian women's 4x100m freestyle relay and the preliminary backstroke leg on the women's medley relay. She would end up getting a medal in both events because of her participation.""I would say during the Olympics I was coming out of my lowest point, which I'm very grateful to say,"" she said. ""I think this whole year has been about building up strength. Since last January I've been building up. It takes a while to get back from an eating disorder.""For a swimmer who was seemingly on a meteoric rise from Rio to the Commonwealth Games into what was supposed to be a breakout Games in Tokyo, not continuing that upward trajectory was disappointing for Ruck.""It was always a fear of mine growing up in swimming, being inconsistent. I don't know if it was a self-fulfilling prophecy or something but it was something that happened. I was inconsistent and it confirmed my worst fear,"" she said.In the wake of the Tokyo Olympics Ruck shared her story publicly for the first time — the sometimes shy swimmer wasn't really sure about doing it but said it helped her on her path to recovery.Ruck, centre, with her teammates in Tokyo. It was an emotional reunion for all at the swim trials in Victoria this past week. (Getty Images)Emotional reunion""I just wanted to share what I was going through. I'm not really a public speaker on a lot of things. It scared me a lot but it was an important thing to do to be heard,"" she said. ""So many people reached out. It was so heartwarming to hear from everyone and so gut-wrenching to hear from people going through it too.""I knew it was a problem but hearing all of that. It does get better and there is support.""When Ruck arrived in Victoria this past week ahead of competition, it was the first time she was seeing her teammates since Tokyo. It was a joyous and emotional reunion with a group of swimmers she's been through a lot with. In the last eight months a lot has changed in her world and she's been feeling stronger and healthier than she has for quite some time.""When I came to their hotel before the meet started I gave everyone big hugs. I started crying once I saw everyone,"" Ruck said. ""I had tears. It was so heartwarming to see everyone because it's been since Tokyo.""Her journey to recovery continues and Ruck isn't taking anything for granted. But she's excited and energized again — and can't wait to get down to business in the lead-up to worlds this summer, and then once again compete for Canada on the international stage.""A lot of coaches and people on deck have told me this week they've noticed a difference in me from last year,"" she said. ""I'm happier and happier. I'm just so grateful to be able to say that.""WATCH l Josh Liendo sets record in 50m free:Canada's Joshua Liendo sets national record in 50m freestyle Duration 0:59 Joshua Liendo breaks the Canadian record in the 50m freestyle with a time of 21.63 seconds and qualifies for the FINA world swimming championships. 0:59Liendo breaks 13-year-old national recordMeanwhile, on the final night of swimming at the national trials, 19-year-old Josh Liendo saved his best for last.

The rules apply for Toronto players travelling south, but the Raptors are 100 per cent vaccinated.The Raptors have faced Philly twice in the post-season, most memorably in 2019 when Kawhi Leonard hit the buzzer-beater in Game 7 of the conference semifinals en route to winning the NBA championship.The Raptors lost to the Sixers in the 2001 conference semifinals, in a thrilling seven-game battle that featured Vince Carter and Allen Iverson.WATCH | Leonard's buzzer-beater sends Raptors past 76ers en route to championship:";"The Toronto Raptors will face their Atlantic Division rival Philadelphia 76ers in the opening round of the playoffs.Chris Boucher scored 21 points and Gary Trent Jr. added 17 for the Raptors, who had their winning streak snapped at three games.""When we started the season and everyone picked us 11th, I was like, `No way, this is a playoff team.We're a playoff team.""'The Raptors head into the post-season on a hot streak that began with a five-game winning streak out west in early March.";['winning', 'way', 'toronto', 'streak', 'season', 'playoff', 'familiar', 'sixers', 'raptors', 'playoffs', '1st', 'round', 'philadelphia', 'meet', 'team', 'foe', 'play'];0.15718475073313784;positive

It was unexpected so it's been a lot of work for sure,"" Mallette told CBC Sports.""The athletes have made it super easy. They're so professional and resilient. We've been through so much together.""Mallette has been with Swimming Canada since 2013 when he moved to Victoria to become the NextGen coach.

The sudden departure is something that's still being processed by Mallette and the many swimmers Titley coached throughout his time in Canada.""Once we get through this meet I'll process it a little further. Right now it's about making sure everyone else is OK and that they're managing well,"" Mallette said.The two had great chemistry and together along with the team around them have created a powerful swimming program with talent and depth.""The way we worked together was in tandem but without saying this is your specific duty. Ben was really big on chatting, picking my brain. We were always having a conversation,"" Mallette said.""Ben would run the program and I would fill every gap that an assistant coach does.""The timing of all of this is certainly less than ideal – one month before trials and three months before this summer's world championship.""Losing Ben has been really hard but I'm just really proud of what we've been able to do this week to get the job done,"" said Sydney Pickrem.""It's huge. He means so much to all of us. It was a shame how it happened. There wasn't a lot of information.

I've been working with Ben for ten years. It's different,"" she told CBC Sports.""I have a lot of faith and trust in Ryan. He's been coaching us for the last two or three years.

We are revisiting it this weekend as part of our Sunday Read series.Charles Hamelin's screams of joy on Wednesday brought back memories of many post-race celebrations Michael Gilday shared with the intense and competitive Canadian short track legend.Gilday, now retired from speed skating competition, was part of CBC Sports' broadcast coverage of short track at Beijing 2022. That included Hamelin's gold on Wednesday, his fourth Olympic podium in the men's 5,000-metre relay. It was his sixth total medal across five Games, tying him with ex-long tracker Cindy Klassen for the most by a Canadian Winter Olympian.The relay medal also tied him with women's hockey players Hayley Wickenheiser, Caroline Ouellette and Jayna Hefford for the most gold won by a Canadian at either the Summer or Winter Games with four.""That is Charles in a nutshell,"" Gilday said about Hamelin's exclamations during the victory ceremony. ""He's extremely passionate and his intensity is unmatched.""I think that level of intensity is what has made him as great as he is.""The 37-year-old Hamelin, who entered his first competition at age 9, is expected to retire following the upcoming short track world championships in Montreal, near his hometown of Sainte-Julie, Que.""I think he's still at the top of his game and can draw on a wealth of experience others don't have,"" Gilday said, ""but it's nice to go out on top [with Olympic gold]. It's a fairy-tale ending to a storied short track career.""WATCH | Hamelin makes history in final Olympic short track race:Hamelin wins relay gold, ties Canadian record with 6th Olympic medal Duration 9:56 Charles Hamelin closed his Olympic career on an emotional high, while the gold medal gives teammate Steven Dubois one of every colour at Beijing 2022. 9:56Gilday, who finished sixth with Hamelin in the men's relay at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, has admired his former teammate's ability to perform at an elite level every weekend for over 15 years.""To me, that is truly the mark of excellence,"" he said. ""Everyone's going to know about the Olympic medals, but he never had a weekend off. If we [his teammates] had a bad weekend, he was always there to bring a [positive] result. When I look back on his career, that's what I'll remember most, the consistency.""Family affairHamelin played baseball as a youngster and was introduced to speed skating by his younger brother François, a two-time Olympian with whom he won 2010 relay gold in Vancouver. A third brother, Mathieu, also skated, while their father Yves helped coach at the national level and was high-performance director for Speed Skating Canada between 2006 and 2014.""Charles is part of a wider family that is short track speed skating in Canada,"" said CBC Sports' host Scott Russell, host of Olympic Winter Games Primetime during Beijing 2022. ""He has staying power and has become an iconic figure in his sport. A fierce competitor devoted to his family and completely aware of the importance of his team.""Yves was glued to his TV in Quebec for Charles' final Olympic race from Beijing along with his son's fiancée, sports journalist Geneviève Lefebvre-Tardif, with whom Charles shares a daughter.""It's a moment in history and we were feeling the emotion between [Charles and his teammates].

The lap times we're seeing now are probably a good half-second faster and the depth of the field is not comparable.""There's no doubt Charles has physical gifts. He's incredibly strong, physically, and that has helped him a lot along the way, but [his recent results] tell you everything you need to know about how well Charles has been able to adapt.""Russell: ""He is a driven athlete and completely aware of his place in the long tradition of short track speed skating in Canada. In many ways, he's the connection between the glory days of Nathalie Lambert, Sylvie Daigle, and Marc Gagnon and the current generation.""WATCH | Canadian teammates pay tribute to 'iconic' Hamelin:Hamelin saluted by his teammates before receiving gold medals Duration 3:01 Canada's 5,000m short track relay team saluted six-time Olympic medalist Charles Hamelin as they stepped/jumped onto the podium. 3:01Vancouver 2010: Double gold on home iceIt was a slow start to Hamelin's second Winter Games, even though he arrived in B.C. in peak form. He finished fourth in the 1,500 and then seventh in the 1,000.Hamelin rebounded in the 500, clocking an Olympic-record 40.770 seconds in the men's quarter-finals on the way to a gold medal, while fellow Canadian Francois-Louis Tremblay earned bronze. Hamelin's celebratory kiss on the side padding after this race with then-girlfriend and fellow short track skater Marianne St-Gelais is a moment many Olympic fans remember as an iconic moment of those Games, right up there with Sidney Crosby's Golden Goal.Minutes later, Hamelin and Tremblay returned to the ice at Pacific Coliseum for the relay, with Tremblay anchoring Canada to victory over South Korea as the top four teams were separated by only 4-10ths of a second.Hamelin clocked an Olympic-record 40.770 seconds in the men's 500-metre quarter-finals on the way to winning a gold medal at the 2010 Games in Vancouver. (Jamie Squire/Getty Images/File)Sochi 2014: Leader of the packHamelin arrived in Sochi, Russia as the clear favourite in the men's 1,500, having earned 11 world medals in the four-year lead-up to the Games, including relay gold from 2011 to 2013.He took the lead with six of 13 ½ laps remaining at Iceberg Skating Palace and held off Han Tianyu of China and Russia's Victor An, stopping the clock in 2:14.99.But Hamelin's Olympics ended in disaster. After winning gold, he fell in his 1,000 quarter-final. Days later, Hamelin slipped on a corner during his 500 qualifying heat, placing 32nd and ending hopes of defending his title.Gilday: ""He was certainly the leader of the men's team, and I would say he was in 2010. Francois-Louis Tremblay and Tania Vicent were probably the veteran leaders, but Charles had been around for a number of years and was experienced, relative to the other members of the team.""What's remarkable is Charles has probably inspired two generations [of skaters] and maybe three, and that's impressive.""Russell: ""It was so fitting that his last race [on Wednesday] was a victory for the team, of which he is the undisputed leader.""PyeongChang 2018: Medal No. 5Hamelin was shut out of the medals in the individual events, placing ninth in the 1,000 and 13th in the 1,500 before teaming with Samuel Girard, Charles Cournoyer and Pascal Dion to grab relay bronze.It was his fifth career Olympic medal, matching Gagnon and Tremblay for most by a Canadian short tracker. Hamelin then made the surprise announcement he would put off retirement for at least one more year.Gilday: ""In 2018, it was very clear he had more to give. He had kind of a bumpy ride [in the individual events] and [three weeks later] won the overall world championship, something that had eluded him for some time and was an important milestone.""Russell: ""His record of success is unparalleled and at times he seemed obsessed with becoming the overall world champion [in 2018]. He then seemed to turn his focus to be a part of the team and leading it into the future. He commands respect and has a great reverence for the forerunners, in particular Marc Gagnon, who he grew up idolizing.Beijing 2022: Flag-bearer, golden goodbyeAfter leaving Pyeongchang with a ""sad feeling"" despite earning relay bronze, Hamelin was determined to return home from Beijing with ""some memories and some [medals].""But first, he checked another item off his Olympic to-do list, leading the entire Team Canada procession — his ""family"" — into Beijing's Bird's Nest during the opening ceremony with co-flag-bearer Marie-Philip Poulin.While he was kept off the podium in the individual 1,500, Hamelin's focus was helping Canada capture relay gold, which made for a golden goodbye at the Beijing Games.""Finishing with a [gold medal] it can't be better than that. Being on top of the podium, it's like the cherry on top to be with these guys. They're like my brothers,"" Hamelin told CBC Sports, referring to Steven Dubois, Jordan Pierre-Gilles, Maxime Laoun and Dion.

The next day, a committee member told one of the elders there had been a complaint, and they wouldn't be allowed to play their drums at the event that ran from April 3-9 on B.C.'s North Coast.""The drum is the heartbeat of the Indigenous people. It always has been. Our singing is an expression of who we are as a people. It's not just a noisemaker, it's who we are. This is probably the last significant thing that we have,"" Barker said.""When an elder brings a drum, the significance rises ... It becomes even more powerful.""Drumming was allowed at official events, however, and a drumming group with the Haida Nation was on the court during the tournament's opening ceremony.Barker said fans are permitted to use other noisemakers, some of which are louder than drums.The ban on drums and singing, he said, is problematic for people who feel a cultural connection to those activities.Celebrating our culture is one of those few things that many of us feel that we have control over and that we can bring to events and people. We can really celebrate who we are.""Since the news of the rule became more widely known, other people took to social media to express their concern.Tournament chairperson Peter Haugan said the rule prohibiting drumming and singing has been in place for several years, but refused to provide CBC with a copy of the tournament rules.He would not answer any of CBC's other questions about the rule.Peter Haugan is the chair of the All Native Basketball Tournament Committee. (Facebook)This isn't the first time the tournament has attracted controversy: in 2020 organizers banned media from attending and covering games.At the time, Haugan told CBC it was because the tournament didn't like negative coverage of political issues at the tournament in the past.Barker said he would like to meet with the organizing committee, along with representatives from other First Nations, to find out more about the rule and explain how important drumming and singing is to many participants.";Players and fans are raising concerns about a ban on drumming and singing by spectators at the All Native Basketball Tournament that wrapped up in Prince Rupert, B.C., on Saturday.The ban on drums and singing, he said, is problematic for people who feel a cultural connection to those activities.Tournament chairperson Peter Haugan said the rule prohibiting drumming and singing has been in place for several years, but refused to provide CBC with a copy of the tournament rules.Peter Haugan is the chair of the All Native Basketball Tournament Committee.At the time, Haugan told CBC it was because the tournament didn't like negative coverage of political issues at the tournament in the past.;['told', 'tournament', 'player', 'concerned', 'significant', 'native', 'committee', 'spectator', 'basketball', 'rule', 'haugan', 'ban', 'singing', 'drumming'];0.11494252873563218;positive

Park.He said walking Texas designated hitter Mitch Garver to start the fourth inning threw him off.""I felt my command, fastball, everything seemed pretty well.

CBC;Tiger Woods shoots career-worst 78 at Masters as hopes fade in 3rd round;"Tiger Woods used to turn weekends at Augusta National into gripping theatre, relentlessly charging up the leaderboard one fearless drive, one feathery iron, one nervy putt at a time.Not now. Maybe not ever again.The magic the five-time Masters champion summoned so easily for so long was nowhere to be found during another laboured four-plus hour journey underneath the Georgia pines on Saturday. His 6-over 78 marked his worst in 93 career rounds at the tournament he has come to define and left him at 7-over.The limp from his surgically repaired right leg growing more pronounced with each deliberate, cautious step, the 46-year-old slipped further down the leaderboard to end whatever chance — however unlikely — of being a factor come late Sunday afternoon.Once a fighter, always a fighter 🐅💪 <a href=""https://t.co/ChBEZ69bVs"">pic.twitter.com/ChBEZ69bVs</a> —@PGATOURThere was no familiar charge in the early April chill. Just the reality that 14 months removed from a serious car accident that threatened to end his career, Woods can still play golf. He just can't do it — at least not at the moment — at the level needed to compete in a field consisting of younger players, many who grew up idolizing him but have long outgrown standing in awe of him.Following a gritty back-nine push on Friday that helped him stay on the fringe of contention, Woods walked to the first tee Saturday two hours before the leaders. Looking to send a jolt through the gallery that stood five-deep in places hoping for a glimpse and a chance to roar, Woods instead spent most of the afternoon silently glaring at the hole or his putter — or both.He three-putted the par-4 first from 54 feet for a bogey, a sign of things to come. On the par-4 fifth, he slung his club in disgust after his approach drifted to the right, far away from a back left hole location. His lag attempt from 60-feet over a ridge was well short. His 9-foot par putt rolled his 3-feet by and his comebacker for bogey hit the hole and bounced out. It was Woods' first four-putt at the Masters — ever.Things never really got better. Three more three-putts followed on an afternoon where nothing really felt right. And it wasn't just his leg. It was his back. His hands. His posture. Everything.Even worse, there seemed to be no way to compensate. He tinkered, the kind of searching usually reserved for the practice range, not in the middle of a major.""As many putts as I had, you'd think I'd have figured it out somewhere along the line, but it just didn't happen,"" he said.WATCH l Canada's Conners tied for 6th place after 3rd round:Corey Conners tied for 6th place after 3rd round of Masters Duration 1:04 Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., shoots an even-par 72 in the third round of the Masters. The Canadian trails leader Scottie Scheffler by 8 shots. 1:04While Woods was slowly making his way up the 18th fairway, leader Scottie Scheffler — just 25 and the world's top-ranked golfer — was making the turn doing at the Masters what Woods has done so often over the last quarter-century: imposing his will on the course and the tournament.""We all wish we had that two, three-month window when we get hot, and hopefully majors fall somewhere along in that window,"" Woods said. ""We take care of it in those windows. Scottie seems to be in that window right now.""A window that is currently closed for Woods. While it would be easy to call his mere presence in northeast Georgia this weekend a victory in itself considering last fall he wondered if he'd ever play competitively again, Woods isn't in this to be a feel-good story. He has no interest in being a ceremonial field filler.His steely 1-under 71 during the first round on Thursday only seemed to embolden him. Following a shaky front-nine 39 on Friday, he recovered to shoot 74 and easily get in under the cutline.He opened with another sloppy 39 on the front Saturday. And for a few fleeting minutes shortly after he made the turn, it appeared another rally was in store.WATCH l Scheffler leads by 3 shots heading into the final round:Scottie Scheffler leads by 3 shots heading into the final round of Masters Duration 1:04 American Scottie Scheffler shoots 1-under 71 in the third round of the Masters and leads Cameron Smith of Australia by 3 strokes. 1:04A crisp iron to 14 feet on No. 12 and a two-putt birdie at the par-5 13th provided a spark that never became a flame. Woods bogeyed the 16th and 17th and his approach up the hill to the 18th sailed into the gallery. His bump-and-run caught the slope and kept rolling, with Woods gingerly chasing after it long before it came to a stop nearly 60 feet away from the pin.Three more putts and his worst round at Augusta was finally over. His 78 was one more than the 77 he put together in the third round of his first trip to Augusta in 1995.He was an amateur back then, a 19-year-old phenom. Two years later, he was a champion. Two-plus decades later, he is a Hall of Famer and one of the greatest in the history of his sport.

Heck, imagine you were building two of them in the middle of downtown Toronto, proper trophy towers for a big bank, and then for a while at least, nobody went to offices at all. They weren’t even allowed to. And then office workers started saying they might not want to ever go back, not like before anyway. What would you do? What might you change for the new normal?Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Employees are 'in the driver’s seat': How employers are trying to lure people back to the office Back to video Spring has sprung at the post-pandemic office. All across North America, big corporate offices are like dry riverbeds after the rain. Last week it was Google. This week it will be Apple. TD just announced plans. The mood is vibrant but tense, with one recent poll showing 81 per cent of Toronto area office workers posted to their homes are happier that way. More than half say they would be comfortable returning to the office in some way, but they are not terribly keen on it, and everyone seems to agree that the old ways of office attendance are gone like the snows of yesteryear. The first Toronto office tower to open post lockdown, CIBC Square on Bay Street across from the Scotiabank Arena, is very nice, the kind of place you might like to spend a day, even a whole work week. The National Post spent a morning there to see plenty of reasons why, all chosen and designed with care, and then rethought and fine-tuned under the wild pressure of a global pandemic that threatened the very concept of the office itself.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Working from home is more productive than going to the office, U.K. data shows ‘I’m not spending all day on zoom anymore’: Heart attack prompts man’s viral rules for living The pandemic sparked a “massive forced experiment,” said Jonathan Pearce, executive vice president of leasing and development at Ivanhoé Cambridge, which broke ground on this first CIBC Square tower in 2017, and is now building the second nearby across the railway tracks to the north. This experiment, about what an office tower should be like after a pandemic, demonstrated what Pearce calls a “fusion of asset classes.” Just as retail merges with logistics, so too does office space merge with hospitality. So the basic strategy was to make these new office towers more pleasant to be in. Pearce said they tried to pivot their offerings to focus more on the office experience, “on what you don’t have at home.”Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “I don’t think people are going to come in to sit on Zoom calls. Companies and landlords are naive if they expect that to happen,” Pearce said. “We were headed the right way, but the pandemic forced us to amplify those services, more focused on hospitality, and more focused on what people don’t have.” The effort is to return time to the employee, to make the commute worthwhile rather than strictly necessary. “It becomes a third place,” Pearce said, after work and home. One early focus that declined in importance as the pandemic went on was the goal of not touching things. Some elements remain in the design, like the building app that sends guests a QR code to scan at entry gates and also programs the elevator to take them to the right floor, with no button pushing at all. But the science on pandemic safety found this was not a main vector of viral spread. So there are door knobs. Some things have buttons. Some things don’t change permanently.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Our conviction from a cultural standpoint was that people wanted to be around other people and this vision of permanently working from home will not come to pass,” said Avi Tesciuba, Canada country head at Hines, a real estate firm that partnered with Ivanoé Cambridge in the CIBC Square project. So there is a tenants-only fourth floor “canopy” deck with harvest tables and a concierge station and places to sit and gather. Meals are similarly prioritized, with offerings modelled on the idea of food trucks, where vendors can cycle in and out of smaller stations, and chairs and stools and benches that are not bolted to the floor, as in the typical franchised basement food court. A white table cloth restaurant from an established name is in the works but not yet announced.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Across downtown on Duncan Street, media conglomerate Thomson Reuters is soon to open its Toronto Technology Centre, where construction started in 2017. A final interior design was ready by early 2020, but the lockdown inspired major changes on the fly. These changes, in turn, will serve as a real-life test of the company’s plans for five new floors in a 57-floor tower to be built above the existing five. The building is heritage designated, the old Southam Press Building, built in 1908, four years after fire wrecked Toronto’s downtown. The project is to design a modern office into an old warehouse that still stands as a relic of a mighty Canadian company long since gone, but with newspaper titles that continue, including this one, which is curious because Thomson Reuters is majority owned by the Thomson family, which also owns The Globe and Mail.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Here near the theatres, the office real estate vibe is a little more bohemian. They do not need to reproduce any food truck vibes. Their employees can just step outside. Here, the most promising lunch is not at that harvest table on the private mezzanine above the marble-clad lobby, but across the street at a casual basement noodle bar run by Toronto’s best loved Thai restaurateurs. But the corporate dynamics of the disrupted office are similar. Thomson Reuters’ initial plan called for 70 per cent of the space to be devoted to “focus” on private work, and 15 per cent each to collaboration and connection. The pandemic revised plan drastically revised that, cut focus space in half, and boosted collaboration to fully 45 per cent of the space.Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Everybody is trying to figure out what the future of work looks like. There is no playbook,” saidMary-Alice Vuicic, chief people officer at Thomson Reuters, in an interview on the first day of the company’s new hybrid back-to-work policy. Employees are newly “in the driver’s seat,” she said, and employers are realizing that, in general, they need less real estate and must use what they have differently. “You have to be much more purposeful as an employer about how you use time in the office,” Vuicic said. “People don’t want to come in to sit at a screen.” Some of the solutions are ingenious, inventive, technological and aim to minimize the use of rented office space. In Montreal, for example, X2O Media markets an “immersive collaboration technology” that sets up a room to remotely recreate a theatre, or musical stage, or conference room, classroom, boardroom or “situation room,” so finely tuned that each screen has a dedicated camera for true eye contact.Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Some solutions are behavioural, but stay in the old spaces of office blocks, like the hybrid model of a reduced in-person work week or hot-desking, where work stations are shared day to day. And some solutions just give up on the old ways altogether, and seek reinvention beyond the pandemic’s disruption. After two years of Zoom meetings and soft pants, the office is back, baby, and it’s not just a desk anymore. * * * Back in the 1990s, when coffee shop culture was all the rage and Friends was set in Central Perk, Starbucks capitalized by pursuing a corporate vision borrowed from sociology. The cafe would aim to be a “third place,” after home and work, that would foster connection and community, and drive the value of the whole enterprise. Just selling coffee at your coffee shop was like just doing work at the office. It is a waste of space. You should also get people to eat there, think there, meet there, reflect there, hang out there, live there.Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content This is almost exactly the pitch some of Canada’s big office employers and landlords give for the new office of the post-pandemic future. Tesciuba of Hines, for example, offers the image of an office worker on a hybrid attendance policy considering whether to go in to the office on any given morning, perhaps wondering why he should bother if he can work just as well at home. In Tesciuba’s vision, the answer would no longer be “because them’s the rules.” It would be because the office is a place of many and diverse attractions, from more efficiently collaborative work to lunch and exercise, drinks and parties, friendships and romances. Office workers can escape the drudgery of home into an urban universe of possibility, dressed up for the occasion in ironed shirts and leather soled shoes. The office is theatre, too. People want to see and be seen.Advertisement 11 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The idea is that the post-pandemic office should offer many things, not just a desk, a restroom, a printer and a nearby reasonably priced egg salad on rye. Like Starbucks’s “third place” goal, this vision is a reaction to sociological research showing that, at the very least, people need some convincing about all this “back to the office” business. “There’s a sense that the workplace has profoundly and irrevocably changed,” said John Wright, executive vice president of Maru Public Opinion, in a recent presentation to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. “While 57 per cent say they would be comfortable returning, only 17 per cent are fully good with that now.” In his survey of almost 800 office workers in the Toronto area who were posted to their home to work during the pandemic, four out of five said their work situation will not return to the way it was. This is not some vain or selfish declaration of intent, but a reflection of where people are today. Well over half said that, given all the adaptation that has already been required by the pandemic, it would be “very difficult” to return to the office full time if that was the order. Nearly 40 per cent said such an order would get them looking for another job, and 24 per cent said they would simply quit.Advertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The office has already changed. Remnants of an office culture that demanded 40-hour weeks in the same desk, like staplers or desk phones, appear today like archeological discoveries. Paper files that you have not consulted in two years have proven that you just don’t need them anymore. Your kids do not look like they do in those pictures anymore. You probably shouldn’t risk that Advil or that gum. The old office is a museum. In the 1980s, George Mazzei, former editor of Gentleman’s Quarterly magazine, published The New Office Etiquette. Today, it might as well be Jane Austen. It is comprehensible, but it is about a different world of different social manners. It also offers a revealing perspective on just how much the etiquette, even the purpose of the office has changed.Advertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In Mazzei’s view, for example, it is “rudeness in the extreme to drop in on someone unannounced at his office and have the receptionist call through.” Today, that sort of impromptu get together is literally designed into the infrastructure. CIBC Square explicitly aims for something closer to hotel lobby than airport terminal. Another outdated view is not thinking of your office space as your own: “We all have to share work space. That is the nature of a company, of a working area. The only thing that endures there is the work itself  the workers are transitory,” Mazzei wrote. “It is never a good idea to view an office as being your own, even though you may decorate it and make it as personal a statement as you can…. The only thing to remember is this: Don’t expend all your creative energies trying to get comfortable.”Advertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content That advice is so 1980s it’s got shoulder pads. It just does not work that way anymore. Workers are transitory? Don’t get comfortable? That vision is as stale as a Rolodex. This is the era of the employee. As Vuicic put it, they are “in the driver’s seat.” That is why CIBC Square does not have a sparse gym in the basement, lit like a bus station, but a fitness centre with towel service and a view of the city skyline, soon to be dominated by its partner tower. It looks like proof the office is here to stay, even if it has to change. It is possible to overstate the cultural significance of a few amenities. This is downtown Toronto real estate, after all. At this price point it should be nice. But the amenities at CIBC make a novel pitch of a new way of work life, from the 35th floor tenants-only lounge with a view of the Toronto Islands to the private park. What’s that you say? Office towers don’t come with parks? That’s pre-pandemic thinking right there.Advertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Post-pandemic, CIBC Square has its own park, artfully landscaped overtop the railway tracks, publicly accessible but privately owned and controlled, with plans for both a winter skating loop and summer garden parties. You know, summer garden parties at the office, just like old times. This new hospitality-heavy vision of the modern office might not last. Real estate trends eventually turn around. Starbucks tried sticking with its “third place” vision at the beginning of the pandemic, but moved away from it with delivery and drive-thru. Offices, likewise, might slip back into the old ways of just being offices, mere arrangements of desks, and some things about work life might never change. Going back to the office after a two-year pandemic is going back to the future. It feels familiar, but you’ve never done it before.Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or Colby Cosh: Liberals slip potentially odious copyright extension into back of budget Back to video If you overlooked this very consequential declaration, you are already forgiven. The budget has a distinct section covering “intellectual property,” but that sentence about copyright, usually considered a subtopic of intellectual property, isn’t in there. It’s not in the section about “supporting artists” either, although the declaration is certainly good news for the handful of Canadians who might happen to be owners of profitable copyrighted material whose arrival in the Canadian public domain will be delayed by two decades. (How many of these persons could possibly exist, one wonders. A dozen? A hundred?) No, the sentence I quoted comes from Annex 3 of the budget, which is a large grocery list of actual legislation that the government intends to enact through, and as part of, the budget.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Whatever your feelings about the singular form of property called “copyright,” the first thing to observe is that the term extension doesn’t have jack squat to do with the federal treasury. If it were to have some effect on government finances, there would have to be an accompanying table with footnotes about the underlying economic assumptions and whatnot. It was simply convenient for the government to make a potentially odious Copyright Act amendment part of the budget so that it wouldn’t be exposed to separate debate in the House. And I know the “this is happening with essential New Democrat support” tocsin has already received a hell of a workout this week, but I’m going to ping it again: the party that ought to be guarding the public domain against private enclosures, the party that ought to be doing this instinctively, is nowhere to be seen.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Jesse Kline: Chrystia Freeland's budget isn't prudent — it's merely less irresponsible than expected Sabrina Maddeaux: Chrystia Freeland's budget crushes millennial home-buyer dreams The term extension isn’t getting much attention because it was taken for granted that it would happen when it was included in the CUSMA agreement. This now leads to a moral paradox: the Liberals surrender to the U.S. Congress and the Walt Disney Company on copyright, and because they are bound by the terms of that surrender — in a manner that apparently does not apply to the dairy stuff in the agreement — we throw up our hands and say “Well, what can you do?” For starters, you might consider legislating transparently. When Disney starts getting nervous about Mickey Mouse plummeting into the public domain, Congress inevitably acts to extend the length of copyright in American law, never without a great deal of fuss. Under the primordial American constitution, copyright could be invoked for a maximum of 28 years whether the author or artist happened to die or not. In 1909 this period doubled to a maximum of 56 years, but in 1976 the law was amended to allow a term of 50 years beyond the death of the author or 75 years, whichever was greater. In 1998, under the “Sonny Bono Act,” the maximum became life plus 70. The original form of Mickey Mouse is now scheduled to enter the U.S. public domain in 2024 unless Congress intervenes again, presumably to add another 20 years onto a copyright period that arguably should not extend beyond the lifetime of the artist at all.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Unless the U.S. culture war gets in the way! Disney’s embrace of modern gender politics has Republican congressmen eyeing up the imminent copyright extension that the company would otherwise expect to receive, again, as a matter of course. We can’t honestly see that there is really so much at stake for Disney, which is a massive harvester of public-domain folk tales written before the concept of copyright was devised: the public mind has long since forgotten that Mickey Mouse is supposed to be a character in cartoons rather than a pure symbol of obnoxious cultural imperialism. What we do notice is that there is at least a debate happening in the States, while our copyright law is altered as an afterthought to a hasty trade negotiation.

On the one hand, they just signed a deal guaranteeing NDP support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau until at least 2025. On the other, the party’s messaging relies heavily on its criticisms of the Liberal government. Rather than square these two mutually exclusive ethos, the party is simply doing both at the same time. According to the National Post’s Anja Karadeglija, Budget 2022 included roughly $15 billion in extra spending in order to appease the terms of the Supply and Confidence Agreement, the official deal under which the NDP agreed not to challenge Liberal leadership in exchange for various . It’s why columnist Carson Jerema wasn’t the only voice to brand it the “Jagmeet Singh Budget,” after the NDP leader. But while the NDP have announced they will vote for the budget, they still plan to publicly slag all the non-NDP parts of it. “We still have critiques and criticisms,” Singh told a Friday press conference. On the eve of Budget Day, Singh even put out a tweet slamming Trudeau’s environmental policy. “In 7 years, Justin Trudeau has not been a climate leader. Real leaders don’t subsidize big oil. Real leaders don’t buy pipelines,” he wrote.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In 7 years, Justin Trudeau has not been a climate leader.Real leaders don't subsidize big oil.Real leaders don't buy pipelines.Real leaders have bold solutions to protect the environment.https://t.co/G8w4Lq9njc — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) April 6, 2022 This doesn’t really happen in the rest of the democratic world, where parliaments are traditionally more fractured due to voting systems based on proportional representation. In most countries, if Singh wanted a say in the federal budget, he’d have to join into a formal governing coalition. That’s the case with the NDP’s German equivalent, the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, who currently run the country thanks to the support of the Greens and Free Democrats. And the thing about coalitions is that they don’t hold up that long when one of the partners is constantly slagging the other one. One 2018 study of countries with a tradition of coalition governance found that it has the effect of forcing politicians not to wantonly slam their political opponents.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by Photo by Yui Mok / POOL / AFP CULTURE WARS Quebec legislators aren’t typically known as free speech libertines. This is the province with language police, after all. But a new Quebec bill is proposing to protect the utterance of “any word” said in a university classroom, which would protect lecturers from professional sanction for using language that administrators or pressure groups might find offensive. “Censorship has no place in our classrooms,” said Danielle McCann, the province’s higher education minister. The context was a University of Ottawa professor, Verushka Lieutenant-Duval, being suspended for contextually uttering a racial slur in class (specifically, the racial slur starting with an “n”). This week, writer Jamie Sarkonak wrote for the National Post about how it’s become routine for Canadian universities to explicitly exclude white males from job applications, even when said job is paid for via government funding. Speaking to the Journal de Montreal, two Quebec Liberal MPs said they thought the measure was going “too far.” This included Joël Lightbound, who recently received national attention for his public criticisms of federal COVID policy. Speaking specifically to hiring policies at Laval University, Lightbound said it’s important to favour inclusion, but “merit has to be prioritized.”Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by Google BUDGET Budget 2022 professed to be so serious about housing affordability that it placed all its housing measures right in chapter one. But the good people at Better Dwelling pointed out that the budget still manages to be chock-full of demand-side measures that will have the effect of pouring more money into the real estate market, thus making the problem worse. These include grants for first-time homebuyers and tax-free home savings accounts to save up for a down payment. “Essentially taxpayers will be subsidizing down payments,” they write. It’s really hard to overstate how much Budget 2022 flamed out on military spending. It was only last month that NATO head Jens Stoltenberg was directly criticizing Canada for phoning in its defence budget. Soon after, Defence Minister Anita Anand was promising “aggressive” measures to beef up Canada’s military in response to a more dangerous world. And yet, the budget only laid out an extra $8 billion over five years. “In the end, all that ambitious telegraphing was for naught,” wrote defence analyst Jeffrey F. Collins in a column for Global News.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content One of the most overlooked sections of Budget 2022 was a provision to extend Canadian copyright terms for another 20 years. Previously, works became public domain in Canada 50 years after an author’s death. Now, it’s 70 years. The Americans forced us to do this as a provision of the renegotiated NAFTA agreement, but a change in copyright law doesn’t really have anything to do with government spending, so it’s weird that it’s a provision of the budget. It was only seven years ago that the Liberals were fierce critics of this exact behaviour in the Harper government, when “omnibus” budget bills were routinely used to slip through any number of unrelated measures.

So, when Fraser says that Quebec’s English-speaking population is angry like never before, one must take the situation seriously. “We feel abandoned,” she told me this week. “For 50 years, we have been told that we have to adapt to the changes in Quebec society. But we get the feeling that it’s never enough, that each time we adapt, the goal posts are moved.” This perception is correct.Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content We apologize, but this video has failed to load.tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or André Pratte: In Quebec, Anglo anger boils, as even the Liberals take a nationalist turn Back to video Quebec Anglos have several reasons to be angry: the attempt by the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government to abolish English school boards  bill 21 banning the wearing of religious signs  bill 96 which, amongst other things, freezes the growth of English colleges  and the withdrawal of a promised subsidy for a new Dawson College pavilion. Directly or indirectly, each one of those measures is an attack against their fundamental rights. Yet, Anglo representatives were not consulted and since then, have been screaming in the desert. No one is listening. In fact, no one seems to care. Even the provincial Liberal Party, once the stalwart defender of minority rights in Quebec, appears indifferent. When bill 96 was tabled in May 2021, the Liberals expressed a “constructive, positive attitude” even though the bill included the wide-ranging use of the notwithstanding clause, meaning that Quebecers intent on challenging the law could not do so based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Quebec’s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content For close to a year, the Liberal leader, Dominique Anglade, refused to say whether her party would vote for or against the bill at third reading. Last February, she finally said that the Liberals would vote against… unless changes were made. “Their ‘No’ is a quiet one, as if they don’t want the nationalists to notice,” deplores Marlene Jennings, chair of the Quebec Community Groups Network and former federal MP. “They should be proud of saying ‘No,’ they’re supposed to be the party that defends minority rights.” Since becoming leader two years ago, Anglade and her team have been obsessed with increasing her party’s among the French-speaking majority, of which only 11 per cent tell pollsters they would vote for the Liberal if an election were held today. Under Anglade’s leadership, the party has taken a “nationalist turn,” which has failed to attract more French votes while upsetting their traditional clientele of Anglophones and visible minorities.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content This nationalist turn reached new heights when a Liberal member of the provincial parliament proposed an amendment to bill 96 that would require students in English colleges to take three of their regular courses in French, an amendment that the CAQ immediately endorsed. “The Liberals have made the bill worse,” deplores Colin Standish, an Eastern Township articling student. More On This Topic André Pratte: Quebec budget will likely add up to another election win for the CAQ André Pratte: Montreal's troubled LRT project still stuck on the siding Standish heads a group called the Task Force on Linguistic Policy. The group is planning to form a new provincial party that would stand up not only for Anglo rights, “but for the fundamental rights of all Quebecers,” says Standish. “We would not be the party of the West Island of Montreal.”Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Not all Anglophones welcome this strategy. Joan Fraser, for one, recalls that “We’ve been down that road before.” In 1989, following then Liberal premier Robert Bourassa’s use of the notwithstanding clause to adopt a new language law, a group of angry Anglo-Quebecers launched the Equality Party. The new party succeeded in electing four members of the National Assembly in the 1989 elections, but that did not prevent Bourassa’s government from being re-elected, and the Equality Party quickly sank into internal bickering and insignificance. Even if the formation of a new party might not be advantageous, the “discussion about a new party might be profitable,” Fraser concedes. Who knows, maybe the provincial Liberals will begin to notice that anglophone voters should not be taken for granted?Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content However, for Anglade, it is probably too late: the trust is broken. Anglo voters may still vote Liberal in the end (the next election will be held Oct. 3), but a significant number will probably vote for this new party, if it sees the light of day. The rest will simply stay at home. The Anglo anger could have deeper consequences than its impact on partisan politics in the province. At worse, Fraser warns, “it could lead to another exodus, especially of young Anglophones.” From 1970 to 1980, tens of thousands of English-speaking Quebecers left the province in the wake of the October Crisis and the election of the separatist Parti Québécois in 1976. That brain drain had enormous economic consequences for Québec. Then, it was mostly unilingual Anglos who were leaving because they could not or would not adapt to the province’s new French reality. Today, most of the young Anglos who are thinking of leaving are bilingual. Their departure would be another economic and cultural blow to Quebec. But maybe that’s exactly what the nationalists want: that Quebec become a totally French, uniform society. How sad… André Pratte is a Principal at Navigator ltd.

Their advice: just leave everything alone and the market will sort it out. I was gobsmacked by their insouciance. Status quo pundits like these past commissioners represent increasingly out-of-touch voices in a now vibrant and global policy and legal debate about what we need to do with large digital technology companies — often called “Big Tech” — and the bevy of new technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain that are changing our world. Recently, for example, the European Union agreed to introduce one of the most significant pieces of legislation to date called the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Notably, an editorial in the Financial Times, hardly a standard-bearer for market regulation, stated that “the bloc should be commended for its tenacity in seeing through sweeping reform. As an attempt to open up the digital marketplace to smaller competitors that up until now risked being bought and then buried by Big Tech, the act is much needed.”Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The DMA is intended to counter the increasing social and market power of the largest technology companies that provide the digital infrastructure for our modern, increasingly techno-scientific economies and societies.

The EU defines these Big Tech companies as digital “gatekeepers” that provide various kinds of digital services or products like social networks (Facebook), search engines (Google), cloud services (Microsoft), operating systems (Apple) and intermediary platforms (Amazon). The “blacklisted” business practices include things like: placing unfair conditions on other businesses using a digital platform  combining personal data for use in online advertising, especially data from children  and limiting interoperability between platforms and ecosystems.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The DMA also includes a number of other elements, such as limits on Big Tech companies acquiring their smaller competitors and ensuring that fines are high enough to deter rule-breaking by these wealthy multinational corporations. The EU is taking the threat posed by Big Tech to innovation and competition seriously, implementing a suite of new laws designed to ensure that these gatekeepers are reined in, while ensuring the continued benefits of new digital technologies. Other EU legislation includes the Digital Services Act and Data Act, which are both under discussion right now. Once they are all complete, EU citizens will have greater control over their personal data, dedicated rules governing the actions of large technology companies and a policy framework designed to stimulate digital innovation across the board — and not limited to a small number companies controlling monopolistic data enclaves.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Canada can learn from the DMA and take a more comprehensive and proactive approach to the changing dynamics of competition in the digital economy. The incremental changes to competition policy recently suggested by the government in the budget are a good first step. But they need to do more. The key problem now, though, is ensuring that Canada’s competition policy debate is inclusive and open to a diverse range of perspectives, including stakeholders from labour, small business, entrepreneurs, consumers and other experts. Unfortunately, in the webinar I watched recently, one past commissioner opined that some voices in this debate should be more equal than others, and the voices that count most should still be certain lawyers and economists and some Canadian businesses. Competition is to be welcomed everywhere, it seems, but in the policy debate itself.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Luckily for Canadians, the current competition commissioner does take the digital economy seriously and has put some thought into what’s needed in this space. It’s still necessary, however, to ensure that a range of voices contribute to this policy debate, as there are still too many lawyers and economists who are blinded by the status quo and averse to thinking differently about our changing economy. We cannot retain the stale ideas of yesteryear and hope to thrive as a country in the 21st century.

National Post;Posthaste: Deutsche Bank was the first to call a recession — but it won't be the last;Good Morning!Economists at Deutsche Bank split from the pack last week when they called a U.S. recession, but they figured they wouldn’t be lonely for long.They argue that the United States will fall into recession late in 2023 as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates more aggressively to deal with inflation now running at a four-decade high — and likely to remain well above target through next year.“Our call for a recession in the U.S. next year is currently way out of consensus,” economists David Folkerts-Landau and Peter Hooper said in their report last Tuesday. “We expect it will not be so for long.”And it wasn’t.Bank of America strategists warned Thursday that inflation could tip the U.S. into recession.“‘Inflation shock’ worsening, ‘rates shock’ just beginning, ‘recession shock’ coming,” BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said in a note to clients.“Inflation causes recessions and inflation is out-of-control, said the note offering historical examples. In the late 1960s the recession was preceded by higher CPI, in 1973/4 it was oil and food shocks  the recession of 1980 was caused by oil prices and in 1990/91 by CPI. In 2001 it was the tech bubble, 2008 the housing bubble. “Last dominos to drop in terms of recession expectations is higher yields & weaker dollar,” strategists said.Deutsche expects U.S. headline CPI at 7.2% annual this year, with core at 5.6%. While improvement on the supply side should lower inflation from those heights, pressure will remain until demand softens. Thus, it expects core CPI to remain at 3% or above until 2025.It expects in response, the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points at each of the next three meetings in May, June and July, followed by 25 bp rises at the remaining meetings, putting the rate at 2.6% by year end. More hikes next year will bring the rate to 3.6% by June 2023. That along with quantitative tightening will amount to more than four percentage points of monetary tightening, it said.“Engineering a soft landing is never easy. This historical fact is particularly acute in the current environment of four-decade high inflation, a labour market well beyond maximum employment, and a global economy that is experiencing a meaningful commodity price shock,” the Deutsche economists said.They also sees recession signals in the yield curves and consumer sentiment. “Yield curves, regardless of which one is in focus, point to elevated recession risks over a two -year horizon,” said the economists. The consumer sentiment recession indicator recently fell to a record low, a reading consistent with a 50% recession probability over the next year.Deutsche expects the U.S. economy to decelerate sharply in the second half of 2023 as “Fed tightening begins to bite more forcefully,” with negative quarters in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2024. A recession is defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction.The good news is Deutsche sees a “mild” recession, but it will lead to a “meaningful rise in unemployment, peaking at 5% in 2024.”Lawrence Summers expects the number of economists forecasting a recession will only grow.Speaking on Bloomberg TV Friday, the former Treasury Secretary said America has never experienced inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4% without an economic slump following within two years. In March consumer prices are estimated to have soared 8%, with the jobless rate sitting at 3.6%, Bloomberg reports.“The combination of overheating, followed by policy delay followed by supply shocks means I think it’s a very difficult set of challenges, and recession in the next couple of years is clearly more likely than not,” Summers said. “I suspect that’s how the consensus will evolve.”Bloomberg’s latest monthly survey of economists showed the chance of a recession over the coming 12 months increased to 27.5% from 20% in March._____________________________________________________________;Economists at Deutsche Bank split from the pack last week when they called a U.S. recession, but they figured they wouldn’t be lonely for long.Bank of America strategists warned Thursday that inflation could tip the U.S. into recession.“‘Inflation shock’ worsening, ‘rates shock’ just beginning, ‘recession shock’ coming,” BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said in a note to clients.“Yield curves, regardless of which one is in focus, point to elevated recession risks over a two -year horizon,” said the economists.The consumer sentiment recession indicator recently fell to a record low, a reading consistent with a 50% recession probability over the next year.;['inflation', 'deutsche', 'rate', 'economists', 'shock', 'bank', 'tightening', 'remain', 'posthaste', 'rates', 'cpi', 'recession', 'expects', 'wont'];0.09544642857142857;neutral

Try refreshing your browser, or Ontario councillor loses day’s pay for saying ‘judgement day’ awaits vaccine supporters Back to video At Thursday’s regular council meeting, Dasha Peregoudova, a labour and employment lawyer with Toronto’s Aird Berlis law firm, and Perth County’s integrity commissioner presented a report on the results of the firm’s third-party investigation into a formal complaint lodged against Herlick following comments he made during a discussion around the implementation of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy for non-unionized county employees during a closed-doors council meeting on Nov. 4, 2021. According to the report, Herlick said any of his fellow councillors who were in support of such a vaccine mandate would face punishment in the afterlife and in a “reckoning” or “judgement day” as described by the Christian faith. Though the person who lodged the complaint was not named in accordance with county policy, the report stated that the complaint alleged that Herlick’s comments were aggressive, inappropriate and offensive, particularly to those who are not Christian.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The complainant also noted that Herlick’s “assurances of Biblical punishment were inappropriate in a council meeting setting and when considering matters of public policy.” According to the complaint, Herlick’s remarks breached the general-integrity clause in Perth County council’s code of conduct, which states, “Members will be open and honest, focus on issues rather than personalities and avoid aggressive, offensive or abusive conduct.” “The purpose of our investigation with this complaint, like any other complaint, is not to make assessments or place value on the councillor’s beliefs … nor his opinions on vaccination policies,” Peregoudova said after reporting that her investigation had found Herlick had breached council’s code of conduct. “The sole purpose of our investigation was to determine whether the councillor breached the code of conduct by virtue of the comments made at that meeting specifically.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content ” … We are recommending, based on the totality of the findings and taking into account that this is the second breach of the code to have been found committed by Coun. Herlick this term, … the suspension of remuneration for a period of 10 days.” Herlick was previously reprimanded by council on Sept. 2, 2021 after he was found to have breached council’s code of conduct by posing for a photograph on Feb. 4, 2021 with members of Liberty Coalition Canada’s End the Lockdown Caucus — a far-right advocacy group established in January 2021 in protest of pandemic restrictions — in which those photographed did not wear masks, practise social distancing or adhere to public-gathering limits during a declared state of emergency and stay-at-home order.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content While Herlick was found not to have breached the code of conduct because of his affiliation with the liberty coalition, investigators found the code was breached when he posed for and shared the photo on social media. Though the investigators said Herlick may have believed he was representing the public and considering the wellbeing and interests of the municipality, they determined he could have advocated against pandemic restrictions without breaking the laws or rules that were in place, as expected from an elected official. Though Herlick was told several times at Thursday’s meeting that he would be allowed only to comment on the recommendations of the Aird Berlis investigators, he repeatedly referred to the investigation as frivolous and suggested Perth County Warden Jim Aitcheson “call me to order” if Herlick were ever to step out of line while speaking at council meetings in the future.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “It’s safe to say that all of council here has been called to order or called point of order, and I get maybe that wasn’t the way the (complainant) wanted to take the route here, but business really did continue well through that meeting. … I have no problem with a phone call or through the warden, give me call. I’m a fair fella. Staff reaches out to me regular(ly) and I talk with many councillors regularly,” Herlick said, before being interrupted by Aitcheson attempting to refocus Herlick’s remarks on the report’s recommendations.” Based on the responses Herlick gave them after they shared with him their findings, the investigators said in their report that it was clear Herlick “feels overwhelmingly justified in relying on his faith to advocate for his position on issues, as he genuinely believes that mandatory vaccination policies are harmful to citizens. He also has general concerns for humanity or morality related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The councillor appears to strongly adhere to his interpretation of these events as they relate to Christianity, and accordingly, he is of the view that he, as a believer, is obligated to ‘call out and raise concern if you see sin.’”Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content When it came time to put the investigators’ recommendation to dock Herlick 10 days’ pay to a vote, the motion was defeated on an even split with Herlick’s colleagues from Perth East council voting against it. Similarly, a motion to officially reprimand Herlick was also defeated. Ultimately, the majority of council opted to dock the councillor one day’s pay along with an official reprimand from council. “We have something of a history of trying to rely on expertise, and, in this particular case, the integrity commissioner has made an expert recommendation which we have rebuffed,” Coun. Todd Kasenberg said. “I just find it interesting in this case that we have spurned a recommendation and … I express some concern about that.”Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “I think we have to show the public that we do not agree with (this), that there was a code-of-conduct breach,” Coun. Bob Wilhelm said before council voted. Later in the meeting, Coun. Hugh McDermid asked staff to bring back a report on the costs and staff time associated with integrity commissioner investigations that will include information on why the names of those who lodge complaints with the commissioner are kept confidential. “I would just ask for support to end the code of conduct,” McDermid said. “It does not allow you to know who is accusing you and I’d just like to know where that came from. … I just find that extremely un-Canadian because in Canada you do get the right to face your accuser.” Galen Simmons is a reporter at the Stratford Beacon HeraldShare this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

The national holiday, Russia’s most significant date in its political-military calendar, celebrates the anniversary of the Soviet Union’s triumph over Germany in the Second World War in 1945. The setting of this deadline could result in dangerous escalation in Ukraine, geopolitical commentators have warned. Russian officials say peace talks with Ukraine are not progressing as rapidly as they would like, and have accused the West of trying to derail negotiations by raising war crimes allegations against Russian troops in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Six weeks into Putin’s invasion, war enters new phase that could decide Ukraine’s fate United Nations suspends Russia from human rights body over Ukraine Speaking in an interview with Russian state television, Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Lavrov said that President Vladimir Putin had ordered to suspend military action during the first round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in late February but that Moscow’s position had changed since. “After we became convinced that the Ukrainians were not planning to reciprocate, a decision was made that during the next rounds of talks, there would be no pause (in military action) so long as a final agreement is not reached,” Lavrov said.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Though not officially announced by the Kremlin, General Alexander Dvornikov, commander of the Southern Military District, will now lead Russian troops on the ground, according to Western security officials and diplomats with knowledge of the change. Dvornikov, 60, has held several senior positions in the Russian military, including army commander of the Far Eastern Military District. He notably oversaw Moscow’s forces in Syria in 2015 and 2016, where they fought alongside Syrian government troops in a conflict where President Bashar al-Assad was accused of using chemical weapons against his own people. The General had been responsible so far for operations in the south and east of Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War. The lack of a single overall commander had “clearly hindered the cooperation of Russian forces,” it said in a report dated April 9.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that Moscow was seeking to “bolster troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service since 2012”. The MoD said Moscow was also turning to recruits from the separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova to cover “mounting losses”. NATO estimates that Russia has lost 7,000 to 15,000 troops during the six-week war, a startling number, while Ukraine puts the toll at 18,600. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Ukraine must win”, said Mykhaylo Podolyak, a presidential adviser, “and once that happens Ukraine will have a more powerful negotiating position.” Lavrov last week accused Kyiv of presenting Moscow with an “unacceptable” draft peace deal that deviated from agreements the sides had previously reached. Kyiv dismissed Lavrov’s comments at the time as a tactic to undermine Ukraine or divert attention from war crime accusations against Russian troops. In the interview aired on Monday, Lavrov also said that calls by Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, for the bloc to continue arming Kyiv marked a “very serious U-turn” in European policy.Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or Wesley Wark: The behind-the-scenes 'spy war' with very real consequences for Ukraine Back to video American and British intelligence assessments have exposed major rifts between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his military and intelligence services, painting a picture of a ruthless Russian dictator surrounded by fearful courtiers who are unwilling to tell him the truth about the challenges and failures of his war. There are reports, credited to Agentura, a Russian investigative website, that senior officers from Russia’s internal security service, the FSB, have been placed under house arrest. This follows a leak from a FSB whistleblower that portrayed his service as having been deliberately kept in the dark about the invasion plans. Dictators get the intelligence services they deserve, and Putin appears to have gotten his in spades. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken calls the absence of truth-tellers in the Russian system the “Achilles heel of autocracies.”Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content But there is a downside. A self-anointed, messianic Putin who’s convinced of the rightness of his war but does not know what is happening on the ground is bound to exacerbate and deepen this conflict. This has even the Pentagon worried. Its spokesperson, John Kirby, told a press conference on March 30 that Putin “may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine. That’s a little discomforting, to be honest with you.” The strange paradox of the spy game is that while you want to gain an information advantage, you need your adversary to be half-way good at the game, to avoid your foe doing stupid things. Authoritarian regimes tend to have big, ruthless intelligence systems. They’re good at cracking down on dissent, but not so good at seeing the world through clear lenses. As the Russian war falters, its lenses are growing darker.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content NATO and European Union countries are busy removing Russian spies from their well-padded nests in Russian embassies and consulates. The United States began the campaign four days into the Russian invasion by expelling 12 Russian diplomats, allegedly spies, from the United Nations mission. More recently, a massive wave of expulsions have been announced by Germany (40), France (35), Italy (30), Spain (25), Belgium (21), the Netherlands (17), Ireland (4) and the Czech Republic (1). Altogether, some 230 Russian officials have been expelled by EU countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. One surprising tally was racked up by Slovakia, which ordered 35 Russians from the Embassy in Bratislava to pack their bags. Slovakia has also been busy cleaning house, arresting a colonel from the defence ministry, a member of its own intelligence service and a pro-Russian blogger.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content If the Russian spy effort in Slovakia appears outsized, it is for a reason: the Kremlin clearly considered tiny Slovakia a vulnerable target, with weak counter-intelligence defences and a minority that’s more than willing to subscribe to Russian propaganda. Preventing Russian agents from engaging in espionage and influence operations across Europe and the western world is important. But it also means a reduced ability by Russian intelligence to report to Moscow on the true strategic picture of NATO and EU opposition to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and on the West’s determination to impose financial and military costs on Putin’s regime. The spy contest may ultimately play out most fiercely within Ukraine itself. In keeping with their remarkable military resistance, the Ukrainians have achieved an intelligence advantage on the battlefield by exploiting Russian weaknesses and capitalizing on technological innovation born of necessity.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Russia’s encrypted communications systems are failing in Ukraine, partly because Russian bombardments have destroyed parts of Ukraine’s telecommunications infrastructure, forcing Russian commanders to use public radio channels and phones, which are easily intercepted by both Ukrainian military units and eager civilian volunteers. Radio and cell interception provides opportunities for lethal Ukrainian targeting, including sniper operations against key commanders operating forward with their units. A Ukrainian air reconnaissance unit, the Aerorozvidka, that began as an amateur group of computer enthusiasts and drone operators, has been credited with some remarkable exploits against the massed Russian column of tanks and armoured vehicles that menaced the capital Kyiv. Russian forces have in recent days withdrawn from the Kyiv region, in apparent disarray.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content But for all the David and Goliath tales that may emerge from Ukraine, there is a darker side to the spy wars. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government has identified and denounced top-level traitors from his security service, shut down pro-Russian parties and recalled ambassadors for failing to do their duty. President Zelenskyy also warned in a public address and on Facebook that, “I do not have time to deal with all the traitors. But gradually they will all be punished.” Across Ukrainian society, there is a spy panic, prompted by fears of Russian saboteurs and agents in their midst. Ukrainian police have been forced to remind citizens not to detain unknown persons on their own recognizance, or threaten them with weapons. Emerging horror stories of war crimes perpetrated against Ukrainian civilians in the suburbs of Kyiv will only deepen the spy panic and the pressures towards vigilantism. Spy wars in the shape of a societal hunt for collaborators can be a malignant cancer, feeding on a desperately tired and wounded society. It will be one of Ukraine’s greatest survival challenges, as the conflict drags on, to avoid succumbing to a divisive and ugly spy war at home while trying to win one against the Russians.

At the time, the killer was still at large and his rampage wasn’t over. He would kill a total of 22 people before being shot by police later that day. At 10:17 a.m., as Westlake was chatting with an RCMP officer parked in front of the building, he watched in disbelief as a car screeched to a halt about 80 metres away and two men emerged with rifles. As both took aim at him, he made a dash for the firehall. “I remember a shot that sounded like a sonic boom and then another one that was really loud, and I’m moving at this time,” Westlake told a public inquiry investigating the worst mass shooting in modern Canadian history.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by Andrew Vaughan / CANADIAN PRESS The two shooters were RCMP officers who mistakenly assumed Westlake was the killer, mainly because he was wearing a yellow-and-orange reflective vest that matched the police description of what the suspect was wearing. Westlake’s dramatic account of what happened that day was given to an inquiry investigator on June 15, 2021. The release Monday of a document that includes excerpts from that interview marks the first time the public has heard Westlake’s version of events. “Do not ask me what deity had their hand on my shoulder that day and made sure it wasn’t my time,” Westlake said in the interview. The inquiry document also highlights the confusion that RCMP officers faced as they pursued the killer for more than 100 kilometres. Two Mounties fatally shot him at a gas station north of Halifax at 11:26 a.m.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content As for Westlake, he said he still couldn’t believe he escaped with his life, though the close call had not hurt his sense of humour. “I was just a fat guy in the wrong place at the wrong time wearing a vest,” he told the inquiry investigator. “I’ve never had malice to the two individuals that pulled the trigger. I want to meet them. I want to ask them how they missed, because I can’t hide behind telephone poles.” Still, the document raises awkward questions for the RCMP, which has said little about the almost-lethal blunder. Photo by THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan Just before Const. Terry Brown and Const. Dave Melanson showed up in Onslow, Westlake was standing in the front lot talking to RCMP Const. Dave Gagnon, who was behind the wheel of a marked cruiser, a vehicle almost identical to the getaway car being used by the killer.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Both Brown and Melanson told inquiry investigators they did not see Gagnon in the car. Before the two officers jumped out of their unmarked Nissan Altima, Melanson tried several times to use a police radio to report what they were seeing. But instead of getting a clear signal to broadcast, Melanson said the radio “bonged,” which meant that the frequency had been jammed by too many users. The Serious Incident Response Team, Nova Scotia’s police watchdog agency, released a report in March 2021 that cleared both officers of any wrongdoing. It concluded the officers had reasonable grounds to believe they had the killer in their sights, and that they discharged their weapons “to prevent further deaths or serious injuries.” The independent agency also drew attention to the jammed radios.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Melanson said he, like Brown, believed the man in the reflective vest was the killer. “I’ve got my carbine on the guy and I’m yelling to him, ‘Show me your hands!”‘ Brown told the inquiry’s investigators last month. “And he’s looking at me and then he ducks behind the car, and I was sure he was getting a gun. And I thought he was going to kill us. I thought he was going to kill others …. And he started running.” Westlake, however, told investigators he did not hear anyone say, “Show me your hands.” He said the only thing he heard, aside from gunshots, was someone saying, “Get down!” As well, eight people living near the firehall told investigators about what they saw that day, and none of them reported hearing anyone say, “Show your hands!”Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In all, investigators found Brown fired four rounds at Westlake, and Melanson fired once. Two rounds pierced one of the station’s garage doors and damaged a fire truck inside. A third round hit a roadside sign and another hit the side of the firehall. The fifth round hit a stone monument near the door that Westlake used to escape. As for Gagnon — the constable in the cruiser — the document says he tried to use his radio to alert the other two officers about his identity, saying, “You guys are pointing your guns at me.” But the transcript from the broadcasts that day suggest the transmission did not get through. All that was recorded was Gagnon saying: “You got that — Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!” and “Who are you shooting at? It’s Gagnon!”Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content When the shooting stopped, Gagnon emerged from his vehicle with his hands up. After a brief exchange with the two other officers, he and Melanson went inside the station, where Westlake told them no one had been injured. Neither Brown nor Melanson checked on the others inside the firehall, who included fire Chief Greg Muise, Deputy Chief Darrell Currie and evacuee Richard Ellison, whose son Corrie had been murdered in Portapique. Westlake would later recall that he had spotted an RCMP cruiser with a black push-bar on the front driving past the firehall at 10:07 a.m. That vehicle matched the description of the killer’s vehicle, but the RCMP did not release that information to the public until they sent a tweet at 10:17 a.m. — roughly the same time the unmarked car arrived at the firehall. There’s no indication that Gagnon saw the suspect’s car. With additional reporting from CP’s Michael Tutton in Halifax.

Try refreshing your browser, or Pakistan parliament elects Shehbaz Sharif as PM. Imran Khan MPs quit en masse Back to video Sharif’s election brings to a close a week-long constitutional confrontation that climaxed on Sunday when Khan lost a no-confidence vote, although the nuclear-armed nation is likely to remain prone to political and economic turbulence. Sharif, 70, who has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician, is the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan’s military, which traditionally controls foreign and defense policy in the country of 220 million people. After the vote, Sharif vowed to tackle an economic malaise that has seen the rupee hit an all-time low and the central bank hike rates by its largest amount in decades last week.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “If we have to save the sinking boat, what we all need is hard work, and unity, unity and unity,” he said in his maiden speech to parliament. “We are beginning a new era of development today.” Just minutes before the vote, legislators from Khan’s party resigned en masse from the lower house of parliament in protest at the expected formation of a government by his political foes. “We are announcing we are all resigning,” Shah Mahmood Qureshi, former foreign minister and vice president of Khan’s party, told the assembly. The mass resignations will require fresh by-elections in well over 100 seats. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had submitted papers nominating Qureshi as its candidate for prime minister.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content ‘INSULT’ The younger Sharif emerged as the leader of a united opposition to topple Khan, a former cricket star who has claimed that the United States was behind his downfall, which Washington has denied. Sharif said in an interview last week good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan’s prickly ties to Washington. Nawaz Sharif was barred by the Supreme Court in 2017 from holding public office and subsequently went abroad for medical treatment after serving just a few months of a 10-year jail sentence for corruption charges. “There can’t be any bigger insult to this country,” Khan, ousted in a no-confidence vote by the same assembly in the early hours of Sunday, told reporters on Monday on the prospect of Sharif being elected.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content No elected prime minister has completed a full term in the nuclear-armed nation since it won independence from colonial power Great Britain in 1947, though Khan is the first to be removed by a no-confidence vote. The military has ruled the country of 220 million people for almost half its nearly 75-year history. It viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favorably when he won election in 2018. But that support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of military intelligence chief and economic troubles that last week led to the largest interest rate rise in decades. Khan remained defiant following his defeat in parliament. Thousands of his supporters in several cities held protests against his ousting that went on until Monday’s early hours.

Try refreshing your browser, or Parker Donham: The hot mess that is the inquiry into a murder spree and the RCMP response Back to video In the aftermath of Wortman’s murderous rampage, neither the federal nor provincial governments were keen to establish a full-bore judicial inquiry — especially not one that could subject the RCMP to the searching scrutiny afforded by sworn testimony and aggressive cross-examination. The feds wanted to avoid a public spectacle that might pressure them to carry out top-to-bottom reform of Canada’s dysfunctional national police force. Then-Premier Stephen McNeil came from a family steeped in police work. His mother was high sheriff of Annapolis County, and five of his siblings serve as police officers. His minister of justice was a retired RCMP officer. The past two decades have seen a string of disastrous RCMP calamities, including incidents in Spiritwood, Sask.  Biggar, Sask. (Colten Boushie)  Mayerthorpe, Alta.  Vancouver International Airport ( Robert Dziekanski)  Moncton, N.B.  and Houston, B.C. (Ian Bush). How long before an inquiry gets to the bottom of the force’s dysfunction?Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Initially, the two governments announced a quiet “joint review” that would conduct inquiries in private before issuing a public report. A furious outcry from families of the victims and members of the public forced them to reconsider. In July 2020, the then-federal public safety minister, Bill Blair, announced a public inquiry with power to compel witnesses and permit cross-examination. Michael MacDonald, an affable retired chief justice of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, would head the inquiry. The commission is generously resourced. Photo by THE CANADIAN PRESS, file Its website lists staff members including a chief engagement officer, seven commission counsel, a commission counsel director, a community liaison director, an executive director and chief administrative officer, an investigations director, six investigators, a mental health director, a mental health support an outreach and engagement coordinator, two policy advisors, a research and policy director, three senior commission counsel, three senior communications advisors, a senior legal advisor, a senior policy advisor, a senior policy lawyer, and a team lead, investigations. quite the gravy boat. Quite the gravy boat.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Despite its clutch of PR specialists, the commission was unable to tell me how much it cost to send a glossy postcard to every Nova Scotia residence extolling its work. An unsigned response from the commission’s anonymous media email address said I could wait for the Public Accounts to be tabled next year. Rubbish. The Public Accounts will certainly not have a line item for that mailing. In recent weeks, a rising tide of criticism has engulfed the commission’s work. Premier Tim Houston complained about repeated delays in getting hearings underway, and the commission’s unresponsive treatment of victims’ family members. A white-shoe Halifax law firm, Patterson Law, took the unusual step of issuing a public rebuke of the commission over its vague and unconventional procedures.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content I feel severely let down … I fought so hard for this public inquiry so another husband and father would not have to go through this lawyers quoting a victim's husband, Nick Beaton “Our clients continue to watch for signs that the public inquiry will proceed as it should, but feel greatly disappointed that, a week before commencement, there is no assurance that it will be anything other than the review that our clients marched to oppose in the summer of 2020,” wrote lawyers Sandra McCulloch and Robert Pineo. “In the words of (Nick) Beaton (whose wife was murdered), ‘I feel severely let down… I fought so hard for this public inquiry so that another husband and father would not have to go through this. The Commission is supposed to ask the hard questions and identify where things went wrong and how things need to change, but right now I just don’t see that happening.’” True inquiries understand that the search for the truth, all the truth, is raw and uncomfortable lawyer Gavin Giles This week, Gavin Giles, a partner at McInnes Cooper, one of Atlantic Canada’s largest law firms, wrote a blistering letter to the Halifax Chronicle Herald, denouncing the commission’s procedures. “True inquiries focus on the who, what, when, where, why and how,” he wrote. “True inquiries understand intuitively that the search for the truth, all of the truth, is oftentimes raw and uncomfortable. True inquiries seek out information by exposing witnesses to direct and frequently aggressive forms of questioning. We are not seeing any of that in the commission’s work to date.”Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content At the heart of the problem seems to be the commission’s mandate that its work be “trauma-informed.” That’s a useful concept when it guides police interviews with sexual assault complainants. It’s foolhardy when applied to a factual inquiry into a mass murder covering 22 killings at 16 locations over 13 hours. Justice MacDonald and his fellow commissioners seem to have taken the requirement to mean they should soft-pedal anything unpleasant — a plan that quickly sent the commission off the rails. More On This Topic Police almost shot the wrong man: Details from the inquiry into Canada’s deadliest mass shooting Excerpt: How Lillian Campbell Hyslop became Gabriel Wortman's 17th victim in N.S. killing spree The family of murder victim Heather O’Brien responded with fury when the commission’s summary of evidence elided one particularly unpleasant fact: Data from O’Brien’s Fitbit showed that her heart continued to beat many hours after RCMP Const. Ian Fahie, who attended the aftermath of her shooting, had wrongly concluded that she was dead — and shooed away paramedics because an active shooter incident was underway.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Const. Fahie is the lower ranking officer in this situation,” wrote Darcey Dobson, O’Brien’s daughter, on Facebook. “He has nothing to gain by lying. More likely he has a lot to lose for telling the truth.” Commission counsel Roger Burrill explained that he glossed over the Fitbit detail because he thought people might find it “disturbing.” Imagine that — who would have thought that an honest and competent investigation into the murder of 22 citizens might turn up anything disturbing. Consistent with this approach, the commission refuses to mention Gabriel Wortman’s name in its documents and its own statements at public hearings. It’s as if his name has magical powers, and by its erasure, everything will be better. Everything isn’t better. The murder of a loved one is an unspeakable life event for those left behind. Its impact never goes away. Family members counting on the commission proceedings are not children. The commission should stop infantilizing them. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly said that the commission website does not include a staff list. • Parker Donham is a retired journalist and communications advisor living in Cape Breton. parker@donham.ca Twitter: @kemptheadShare this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or Racist comments, government credit card misuse and a stolen Blackberry: Ottawa's annual report on public servant wrongdoing Back to video Those are but two of the latest examples of wrongdoings discovered by the federal government in 2020-2021 year, according to its latest annual report on allegations and investigations into wrongdoing by public servants. In that period, 123 public servants made 101 internal disclosures containing a total of 174 allegations of wrongdoing under the federal government’s whistleblower protection act. That is the lowest number in the last four years, which the Chief Human Resources Officer suspects may be a result of bureaucrats largely working from home and thus have less opportunities to observe and report issues. During that period, another 30 investigations were closed leading to 12 allegations of wrongdoing being confirmed and 19 cases in which a department needed to bring in corrective measures to ensure the issues did not occur again.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Sabrina Maddeaux: If Facebook whistleblower was Canadian, she may never have come forward U.S. whistleblower Chelsea Manning challenging secrecy laws barring her from Canada A first case of confirmed wrongdoing involved an executive at Global Affairs Canada (GAC) who was accused by a whistleblower of “gross mismanagement” because of staffing “irregularities.” The complaint also accused the executive of both repeatedly making inappropriate comments to employees, “some of which were of a sexual nature,” as well as engaging in systemic harassment through “inappropriate behaviours” with colleagues. The report does not identify any of the current or former public servants involved in each case. Though the investigation found there was no gross mismanagement, it did find that the majority of allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and behaviours were true.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The document does not mention sanctions against the executive, but they were ordered to take sensitivity training and coaching. The report also notes they left the public service before the investigation ended. But the executive seemingly left a mess behind, as GAC committed in the report to working to “restore” the work environment in the affected workplace. Two other cases of wrongdoing were found at Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). In the first case, investigators discovered that one of ESDC’s Internal Integrity and Security Offices, whose role is “assessing the reliability and loyalty to Canada of applicants and employees,” broke the government’s own contracting rules and regulations.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Furthermore, investigators also concluded that an ESDC manager “seriously” breached the department’s code of conduct when they told an employee to commit an undescribed act of wrongdoing. The document contains almost no details as to what the wrongdoing was, except to note that the department needed to review its governmental credit card policies in order to “mitigate the risk of misuse.” It also notes that government will review all dealings between the department and an unnamed private security company. “The Chief Financial Officer Branch will review the past and ongoing transactions between ESDC and the private security company, identify any unacceptable transactions, and implement corrective measures to ensure that the proper procurement practices are put in place immediately with regard to the procurement of security services,” reads the report.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content It is unclear if any employees were sanctioned following the investigation, as the document only notes that corrective or administrative measures were still “being determined” at the time of publication. A separate investigation by ESDC found that a former employee committed wrongdoing by leaving with a government-issued Blackberry cellphone and continuing to use it after retiring. The device has since been recovered and disconnected. A final investigation detailed in the report found “gross mismanagement” by a director working at Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada’s national headquarters. “It was alleged that the director bullied and marginalized another employee under their supervision (including using vulgar language and inappropriate racial comments), failed to disclose a conflict of interest in the promotion of another employee in which a personal relationship existed, and failed to disclose a conflict of interest in the approval of a sole-source contract with a third-party organization in which a financial stake was held,” reads the report.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Investigators found every single allegation to be true, but no sanctions are noted against the director in question, possibly because they resigned before the investigation was closed. In 2020-2021, the report reveals that government looked into 188 allegations (including some from backlogs from previous years) and launched 63 investigations looking at anywhere between one and nine allegations of wrongdoing. The largest number of new investigations were launched at Global Affairs Canada (13), Public Services and Procurement Canada (13) and Employment and Social Development Canada (10).Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Chief electoral officer Greg Essensa wrote to the chief medical officer of health in the summer of 2020 asking for a task force, and the two offices have been meeting regularly since then, he said. Elections Ontario is taking the advice of the top doctor as well as looking at how other jurisdictions have run elections over the past two years. When voters show up on June 2, they will see floor signage for physical distancing, Plexiglas screens, hand sanitizer and masks available — face coverings won’t be required of voters or staff but will be supplied for those who want one.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Randall Denley: Ontario's PCs have finally got a killer plan to win the election Premier Doug Ford's nephew Michael Ford to run for Conservatives in Toronto riding But Essensa is hoping many voters consider avoiding ballot boxes on June 2 altogether. “I think one of the things that we’re really trying to do this election is really look at flattening the curve of the vote,” he said in an interview. “Traditionally in Ontario — it has always been this way — probably 85 to 90 per cent of those who vote, vote on election day … we want electors to vote when it’s convenient for them, when the time is right for them, ensuring that they can come and vote in a safe, secure fashion. Really, that’s our ultimate goal.” This year, there will be 10 days of advanced voting, up from five, Essensa said, and the local returning officer can move the poll location. It could be held for a few days in one community, then a few days in another community in the riding, which will be particularly helpful for rural areas, he said.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content As well, Elections Ontario has a new online process to apply for a mail-in ballot. People can sign up from May 4 to May 27 and the local returning officer has to have the ballot by 6 p.m. on election day. Other provinces that have held pandemic elections have seen significant increases in demand for voting by mail, Essensa said. Ontario only had about 10,000 people vote by mail in the 2018 election, but this year it will likely be far more. In last year’s federal election, 300,000 of the mail-in ballots came from Ontario, Essensa said. On the campaign trail, the NDP is still planning to prioritize in-person events for leader Andrea Horwath, but will have a number of public health measures in place, said the party’s executive director.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “(With virtual events) there is something that is lost, that sort of warm, human feeling that you get when you’re in a room with folks,” Lucy Watson said in an interview. “The virtual events that we’ve done have been hugely successful, tremendous turnout, tremendous energy, and I think folks have still been able to make that connection. But, again, our preference and our priority is certainly to have the leader meet with Ontarians in their communities.” Planning is still underway, but many events will likely look like a rally Horwath held last Sunday — outdoors with masks required, Watson said. All candidates and any volunteer who will interact with a member of the public are fully vaccinated, she said. When canvassing, the party is “strongly encouraging” candidates and volunteers to stay masked, Watson said. Recently, one incumbent candidate tested positive for COVID-19 a day after door knocking in her riding. She and others in that situation will adhere to all isolation guidelines, Watson said.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The party also plans to have a COVID compliance staff member as part of the central campaign, she said. “We believe that it’s our shared responsibility to mitigate risk, and our primary goal is to ensure that activities are safe for the volunteers and the campaigners, the candidates and for the members of the public who are interacting with them,” Watson said. The Liberals came under fire from some supporters for a recent indoor event at which candidates appeared unmasked, though public health rules were followed. Party spokeswoman Beckie Codd-Downey said for the duration of the campaign they will continue to follow restrictions. “Our candidates are all vaccinated and future candidates will be as well,” she said in a statement. “(Leader Steven Del Duca) loves to be out on the road connecting with people and we plan to continue as long as it’s safe.”Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Becky Smit, the Ontario Greens’ campaign chair, said they will follow the advice of public health experts. “That includes taking precautions like masking and physical distancing at indoor events, and using outdoor spaces when possible,” she said in a written statement. “We’re running a versatile and flexible campaign and are ready to pivot as needed.” A statement from the Progressive Conservatives said the party “will continue to follow all public health rules.” As the campaign approaches, Elections Ontario has launched a new app, which will let voters map their poll locations, see candidate information, options on ways to vote and get notifications when a new candidate is registered. It also provides an electronic version of the voter information card, complete with barcode.Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or Charities will soon have a higher spending quota to keep charitable status Back to video Every year, charities are obliged to spend a minimum amount in order to keep their charitable status with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), called the disbursement quota. That rate stands at 3.5 per cent of a charity’s eligible assets, which most charities exceed yearly. But a growing chorus of experts in recent years have called for an increase to anywhere between five and 10 per cent over to avoid excessive wealth accumulation, particularly by some of Canada’s largest charitable foundations. A report late in October by media outlet The Logic also found that thousands of charities and major charitable foundations failed to meet that minimum threshold. That represented more than $400 million in unspent charitable funds.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In the federal 2022 budget published Thursday, the Liberal government announced It was finally increasing the quota to five per cent, but only beginning in 2023, and only on the value of assets that exceed $1 million. “This would increase expenditures by charities overall, while accommodating smaller grant-making charities that may not be able to realize the same investment returns as larger charities,” reads the budget. The move was welcomed by Philanthropic Foundations Canada, whose president and CEO said in a statement that it will “lead to an injection of crucial funding into communities, while ensuring funding remains available for granting over the long term.” But others, such as Charity Intelligence (CI) Canada and charity tax expert Mark Blumberg, have called for a higher minimum disbursement quota of up to 10 per cent.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In their submissions to government on the issue back in the fall, CI said 22 per cent of Canada’s 72 largest private foundations did not meet the 3.5 per cent quota in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Liberal government essentially provided an increase but listened to foundations and did the absolute minimum that they could get away with,” Blumberg said. “The Liberals could have increased the disbursement quota last year or in any one of the last six years. The failure of the Liberal government to act on this matter has resulted in tens of billions of dollars not making it into the hands of operating charities and beneficiaries.” In the latest 2020-2021 Charities Program report, the CRA noted that there are nearly 86,000 charities in Canada with total assets worth over $500 billion. The sector’s total expenditures during the same period was nearly $300 billion. More On This Topic John Hallward: Charitable foundations are preventing money from going to those who need it.

Try refreshing your browser, or Kenney urges unity in last speech before leadership ballots are mailed to UCP members Back to video Speaking to a special general meeting of the party, Kenney characterized the mail-in vote — which will decide whether he continues to lead Alberta’s ruling party — as one that will decide whether the UCP stays united or falls apart. “Friends, I am here to ask that we unite. I have not been a perfect leader, I’ve made mistakes. I ask that you not compare me to the Almighty, but to the alternative,” said Kenney, acknowledging he borrowed the line from former prime minister Stephen Harper. “I truly fear that if we choose the path of division, it will drive a wedge right down the middle of our party for which we may never again recover and there’s only one person who wins from that, and her name is Rachel Notley,” said Kenney, who added he has never lost an election.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Unity requires constant effort — it can never be taken for granted — but division is easy.” While Kenney accused the Opposition NDP of attempting a failed “socialist lab experiment” that raised taxes and created an “economic disaster,” he also acknowledged the hardships COVID-19 restrictions brought upon some Albertans. “I ask for your forgiveness if there were decisions that we made which you think were wrong or which offended you,” he said. Beginning next week, mail-in ballots will be sent to almost 60,000 registered party members eligible to vote. They’ll need to be received by the auditing firm, Deloitte, overseeing the vote by May 11, but results won’t be published until more than five weeks after this weekend’s event, on May 18.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Kenney said he would accept and respect whatever decision members make and step down if they want to elect a new leader. “I believe all of our members will expect every member of our caucus, and our team also, to respect the decision of the members democratically expressed,” said Kenney. His address came after the UCP’s board last month made the controversial decision to move the in-person meeting in Red Deer to a mail-in ballot after 15,000 people registered to attend. Despite Saturday’s event being billed as virtual, dozens of Kenney supporters were gathered at the Cambridge Red Deer Hotel and Conference Centre to enthusiastically cheer on the premier for the live-streamed speech with signs and “Vote Yes” buttons. With a rally in support of the Ottawa trucker convoy descending on Red Deer the same day, private security blocked off entrances to the hotel’s parking lot. Invitees exiting the conference centre after the speech who spoke with Postmedia declined to comment.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Kenney will need to get a 50 per cent plus one majority to survive the vote, otherwise the party will be thrust into a leadership contest with roughly one year to prepare for the next election. On Saturday, UCP president Cynthia Moore emphasized the mail-in system is the most democratic way to hold the vote, but critics have raised concerns about changes to the process they have said tilt the odds in Kenney’s favour. Longtime Kenney foe Brian Jean, now a UCP MLA for Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche, said in a Saturday statement Kenney’s rhetoric and approach has divided the party, which “should be much more than just one person.” “The premier gave a speech that said the choice is between more-of-the-same or Rachel Notley’s NDP — you know someone is losing when they resort to fear,” said Jean.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt told Postmedia Kenney’s speech was full of hyperbole aimed at Notley and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and “red meat” for the party’s base. “There was no point in fact-checking the speech … It was the overall theme, and it was, ‘You have a choice — you can have division, chaos, socialism, lunatics, or me,'” said Bratt. Despite Kenney urging members and his caucus to respect the count, regardless of the results, Bratt said the premier will still face major challenges getting cash and volunteers for a re-election campaign with some — including his own MLAs — opposing him. “This party will not be united on May 18,” said Bratt. NDP Leader Rachel Notley, speaking at a party nomination event in Calgary, said Kenney’s speech avoided important issues. “The real issue here is that they’re not talking about Albertans, and whether they talk about me or whether they talk about each other or whether they talk about lunatics and kooks — it doesn’t really matter. What they’re not doing is talking about the things that matter to the people of this province,” said Notley, who noted Kenney didn’t directly address the families of those who died of COVID-19, or challenges faced by exhausted health-care workers and teachers. lijohnson@postmedia.com twitter.comeportrixShare this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Try refreshing your browser, or Details on Liberals' growth plans in the budget will not come until fall Back to video Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s budget on Thursday included $15 billion over the next five years for a new growth fund meant to make major investments to reduce emissions as well as strengthen supply chains. They also announced a new innovation investment agency that will have another $1 billion to invest in promising new technologies, with the goal of attracting private-sector investment. Former Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan, who chairs a new business group called the Coalition for a Better Future, said investing in productivity and growth like this is exactly what they have been advocating for. “The direction and the purpose is good and absolutely in line with what the coalition has been talking about,” she said.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The coalition is an advocacy group launched last year focused on sustainable economic growth and has highlighted Canada’s lagging indicators in productivity and in research and development investing. McLellan said many Canadian companies are doing very well and it’s time to spur them to invest more. “There’s a lot of money on a lot of balance sheets and it is time to encourage the private sector to invest that money to enhance productivity, to enhance R&D, innovation, invention, and in the longer term, sustainable economic growth.” In the government’s budget documents, the Liberals pointed to similar agencies in Israel and Finland. Both countries have among the highest levels of private sector investment in research and development.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Israel has the highest concentration of startup companies in the world and the Israel Innovation Authority has played a role in many of them. The authority’s former chief scientist, Avi Hasson, told Forbes that the government has to take part in some of the riskiest investments to allow private capital to follow. McLellan said the government has to ensure it structures these new agencies in a way that empowers them to take risks. “The culture will be important and it has to be an entrepreneurial culture, a culture of risk taking, a culture where failure — while we don’t want it — is to be expected in certain cases.” There's a lot of money on balance sheets and it is time to encourage the private sector to invest it Anne McLellan The government has said it will be autumn at least before the growth fund and the innovation agency take shape, but McLellan said the recognition that Canada has a problem is a big step.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “It’s pointing us in the right direction. It’s embracing the notion that we need more private sector investment, but that the government is there to partner with the private sector.” Mark Agnew, vice-president of policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said they’re interested in the details of both these new government agencies. He said they hope the government ensures they are truly arm’s length and don’t become bureaucratic. “There’s always a risk with these things that they are created with good intentions, but then they get bogged down from the inability to focus,” he said. Early in their first mandate, the Liberals launched the Canada Infrastructure Bank with a $35 billion investment that was designed to attract private capital while building important projects. The bank was slow to get started and hasn’t attracted a significant amount of private capital.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Agnew said if the government is going to try to attract private money with its new proposals it has to find the right projects. “For that to work, you have to have projects that have viable revenue streams for private sector companies to see how they’re gonna get a return on their investment,” he said. More On This Topic ‘Insidious problem’: The federal budget finally puts an emphasis on growth Federal, Ontario governments invest over $500M in General Motors’ $2B production boost Agnew said it is an undeniable fact that Canadian private companies are not investing enough in R&D, but he said there are more issues than money at play. He said the government should also be looking at regulations and other barriers. “If you don’t have regulatory certainty, it’s going to be really hard to have a good pipeline of investable projects where people say, ‘I’m gonna put some money in to making this happen,’” he said. “I think it comes down a lot to our ability as a country to build transformative nation-building projects.” Email: rtumilty@postmedia.com | Twitter: @RyanTumiltyShare this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

They weren’t always the biggest fans of the Japanese buckwheat noodle. But as soon as they had “really good soba” in Japan, that changed. “Soba’s one of those noodles that we both fell in love with at a later date in our love affair with noodles,” says Stephanie. “Because when you think of Japanese noodles, people obviously always think of ramen. And then they think of udon next and then soba.” In non-pandemic times, Mike and Stephanie divide their time between Vancouver, B.C., Palm Springs, Calif. and Tokyo.

Making it from scratch is kind of like making tea: kombu and bonito (or one or more other dried fishes) are steeped in hot-but-not-boiling water. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and add a 4 x 4-inch piece of kombu along with 1 cup of high-quality bonito flakes. Let steep for 10 minutes, then strain. For a shortcut, pick up dashi “tea bags ” they are super simple to use and you should be able to find them at any Asian grocery store or online.

Try refreshing your browser, or Film review: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Back to video That’s not my own synopsis  it’s an actual line of dialogue from the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog, which was released in February of 2020, or about 10 years ago in pandemic time. That one was a decent timewaster – I gave it a barely passing grade of 2.5 stars – featuring Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, James Marsden as his human father figure, and Jim Carrey living it up as the villain, Dr. Robotnik. Sonic 2 gives us more of everything, but mostly computer-generated video game characters, since this time the cobalt blue speed demon is joined by two primary colour companions, the good-natured Tails (voiced by Colleen O’Shaughnessey) and the evil Knuckles (Idris Elba). Though from the start it seems as though Knuckles might be merely misunderstood.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Carrey remains the definitive villain, beginning the movie marooned on the Mushroom Planet with only a stone head for company. (And what I wouldn’t give for an entire film of him stranded there, Cast Away style. Alas, ’twas not to be.) Back on Earth, he and Knuckles team up to find an all-powerful emerald. Sonic, who’s been trying an mostly failing to operate as a Spider-Man style superhero, recognizes a redemption arc when he sees one, and decides to foil Robotnik’s plan and prove his worth in the process. This leaves the non-overacting human characters (Marsden and Tika Sumpter as his wife) with little to do. Returning director Jeff Fowler quickly shuffles them off on a Hawaiian vacation/wedding, which I thought was merely a ploy to sideline them, but turned out to have some significance to the larger plot. This is in part why the movie runs an excruciating (for kids) two hours and two minutes.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Sonic 2 is full of video game Easter eggs and the usual run of pop-culture references, including an odd, jokey repetition of a presidential remark first uttered after the 2017 Charlottetown rally that seemed in poor taste. But for the most part the mood is goofy fun that never gets too dark or frightening for either the under-10s or the film’s other target demo, nostalgic millennials. Even with its long runtime it struck me as a step up from the original. Viewers should sit tight as the end credits roll, as there’s a single mid-credit scene that left audience members of all ages at a recent preview screening hooting and hollering. Without giving too much away (and recalling that the director is also attached to a new live action/CGI Pink Panther movie) let’s just say that Fowler is going to be adding yet another colour to his cinematic palette soon.

Because for him, it was not a very ambitious job. And I told him, ‘You know that with cooking, I will be rich and famous,’” says Cocagne, laughing. “I will write books that will be published all over the world.” True to her word, Cocagne’s debut, Saka Saka (with photographer Aline Princet  Interlink Books, 2022) has been published in three languages — French, German and, as of April 12, English — with hopes of a Spanish edition to follow. “For me, it’s really a blessing,” adds the Paris-based chef, artistic director of Afro Cooking magazine, president of the We Eat Africa food festival, and star of the Canal+ TV series Rendez-vous avec Le Chef Anto. “I hope that it’s going to be a testimony for other African people who want to share our products and recipes and everything about Africa.”Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Growing up in Libreville, Gabon, Cocagne had her heart set on a culinary career. In high school — where “every lunch, it was beef baguette” — she sold homemade pastries to her fellow students and neighbours. After graduating with a baccalaureate degree, Cocagne convinced her parents to allow her to continue her studies in France: at the Hotel School Lesdiguières in Grenoble and the prestigious Ferrandi Paris — “the Harvard of gastronomy.” She gained experience cooking at the likes of the Carlton Cannes hotel, a Hilton hotel in South Carolina and for various Parisian caterers. Since 2016, Cocagne has concentrated on pan-African cuisine — showcasing the products of sub-Saharan Africa in classic recipes, creations, and classics, revisited.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by Interlink Books When Princet approached her to collaborate on a cookbook in 2018, Cocagne was immediately interested. The photographer had contacts in publishing and other books under her belt. Even still, it was difficult to find a publisher who wanted to print an African cookbook, Cocagne recalls. One publisher elaborated on its rejection by saying, “Africa is not really profitable.” It took Cocagne and Princet roughly a year to find a fit in Mango Éditions. Though the Paris publisher had released many cookbooks, none had featured the cuisines of Africa  their focus on food south of the Sahara was its first. Proving the skeptics wrong, when the French edition, Goûts d’Afrique (“Tastes of Africa”), came out on October 25, 2019, it was among the top five best-sellers.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “It’s a big responsibility (to be the first). And for me, it means that this is time for Africa,” says Cocagne. “I’ve been in France for 20 years. And when I was a student, and I talked to my chefs about African cuisine, African recipes, they were not really interested.” While food from the Maghreb — northern Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea — is well-known outside the region, she adds, the same can’t be said of south of the Sahara. In Saka Saka, she seeks to change that by shining a light on the staple ingredients, flavours and recipes, including influences from Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast and more. “It’s time for us to share our recipes. To share our knowledge. To share what we have: our treasures. Because we have so many things to share with the world.”Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content When Cocogne first embarked on her culinary career, she viewed her cooking as Gabonese. But as she immersed herself in researching the history of the continent in 2016, she soon saw common threads connecting the food of Gabon to that of its neighbours, such as Cameroon to the north. As varied as the cultural influences, history, climate and geography are, she identified similarities.

And sometimes they adapt the food with the local ingredients they have. But the main product, cassava leaves, is going to be the principal ingredient in the stew,” says Cocagne. “And that’s why I decided to say that my cuisine, it’s not really a Gabonese cuisine. It’s more pan-African cuisine. Because every African who eats cassava leaves is going to recognize (themselves) in this book.” Cocagne has travelled extensively throughout Africa. While filming her television show, she deepens her research by exploring various countries — including Cameroon, ​​DR Congo and Togo — through their cuisines.Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content She visits villages and talks to people: asking them why they cook the way they do, how they learned the dishes and what guides their choice of ingredients. Cocagne is now working on a second cookbook, focused on spices. Writing about the cuisines of Africa is key to her mission of sharing the continent’s produce and culinary traditions with the world. “I think it’s really important,” says Cocagne. “Because for a long time, our knowledge was just an oral transmission. And slavery broke a lot of things we were transmitting to generations. That’s why today it’s important to write. So even tomorrow, if I’m not here, what I write (will be).” Much of the knowledge she has today came from the grandmothers she met in villages during her travels, says Cocagne, as well as from reading books such as Jessica B. Harris’ High on the Hog (Bloomsbury USA, 2012), and academic texts about African history, cultures and cuisines. The pan-African approach she takes in Saka Saka is a result of this research. Instead of focusing on national cuisines, she shines a light on the flavours and foods of sub-Saharan Africa: “Because our countries’ borders were not set by us,” says Cocagne. “Before, we had kingdoms. We had empires that were dislocated by slavery and colonization. And in this book, it was more logical for me to highlight the products that bring us together, rather than talk about countries that divide us.”Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.NP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

National Post;HIV drug shows promise in treating metastatic colon cancer;"HIV drug shows promise in treating metastatic colon cancer""Disease stability in a cancer patient population this advanced, with just one single agent, is highly unusual,"" said researchers.A reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a type of drug often used to treat HIV, has been found to stop disease progression in one-quarter of patients with fourth-line metastatic colorectal cancer.Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital published their findings in the medical journal Cancer Discovery .Colorectal cancer is responsible for approximately 10.2 per cent of all cancer cases worldwide, according to Targeted Oncology .During the study, 32 patients with advanced metastatic colon cancer were monitored — nine were provided with lamivudine, an antiretroviral medication used to prevent or treat HIV and AIDS.“After giving them only this one drug — nothing else — we saw signs of disease stability,” co-senior author David T. Ting said in a statement .The other 23 patients were later given an adjusted dose of lamivudine, and researchers saw a high tolerance to the drug.See More +Another nine of the 32 patients, 28 per cent, had either disease stability or a mixed response when the trial ended — and though that doesn’t mean the tumours decreased in size, the researchers said the results were encouraging.“If we see this kind of response with just one HIV drug, the next obvious trial is to see what else we can achieve with HAART, or highly active anti-retroviral therapy,” Ting said.Ting and the team had found signs that the HIV drug could have potential in cancer treatment nearly a decade ago. As much as half of a tumour’s DNA was made of “repetitive elements,” which, at the time, were considered to be “junk DNA” — a term used for DNA that is non-coding. Since DNA contains instructions to create protein, this DNA is considered “junk” since it does not carry any such instruction.Only cancer cells produced the repetitive element, Ting explained. Colorectal cancers produce a significant amount of those repetitive elements, which exude RNA that can replicate in a viral-like life cycle, which Ting called the “repeatome.”“It’s a way for cancers to change their genome to adapt to stress,” Ting says.Lower rate of colon, breast and prostate cancerPrevious research suggests that HIV patients receiving a three-drug anti-retroviral therapy for the rest of their lives see a significantly lower rate of colon, breast, and prostate cancer when compared to the rest of the general population.“We did the trial to see if we could learn something new about the biology of cancer cells and in the process found this unexpected, very encouraging result,” Ting said. “Disease stability in a cancer patient population this advanced, with just one single agent, is highly unusual and we are hoping we can soon initiate a larger Phase III study with a three-drug reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination.”Researchers suggest that this therapy may prevent cancer, or be able to turn a potentially lethal disease into a chronic one like HIV.According to the Canadian Cancer Society , the survival rate for someone with stage 4 colorectal cancer is about 12 per cent.Chris Arnold is a Toronto-based writer.DON’T MISS A THING: SIGN-UP FOR HEALTHING’S NEWSLETTER Thank you for your support.

National Post;Prunes may have another health benefit: reducing the risk of osteoporosis;Prunes may have another health benefit: reducing the risk of osteoporosisEating six to 12 prunes each day may help lower the inflammation that causes bone loss in post-menopausal women.The humble prune may hold the key to better bone health, according to a new study that found eating dried plums to be a good way to counter the inflammation that contributes to osteoporosis.The work, which will be presented this week at the American Physiological Society’s annual meeting , builds on previous research that the polyphenol extracts found in prunes are capable of lowering levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in a type of bone cell known osteoclasts. While osteoporosis has long been attributed to endocrine, metabolic and mechanical factors, this more recent study suggests inflammation plays a key role in bone turnover .Osteoporosis is often referred to as “the silent thief” because bones lose their density slowly over the years without presenting any obvious symptoms. As adults age, the natural process that replaces old bones becomes less effective, resulting in a loss of bone tissue.As of 2015 to 2016, approximately 2.2 million Canadians aged 40 or older were living with an osteoporosis diagnosis, according to a report by the Canadian Chronic Surveillance System . About 80 per cent of those diagnosed with the metabolic disease, which is characterized by low bone density and an increased likelihood of fracture, were female. Older women are particularly susceptible to osteoporosis because their bones are generally less dense than those of men and as they age they experience a decline in estrogen, a bone-protecting hormone.From 2015 to 2016, the report noted that diagnosed patients suffered around 130,000 fractures, mostly to the forearms. The rate of fractures was higher for women than men and increased in likelihood with age. Despite the fact that these fractures are associated with significant mortality and expense, most high-risk individuals neglect to undergo appropriate screening or treatment.To see if prunes might be able to reduce some of the inflammatory fallout of aging, researchers recruited postmenopausal women with a low bone mineral density score (an indicator of osteoporosis) and divided them into three groups. The first group was required to eat 50 grams (about six prunes) a day for a year  the second ate 100 grams (about 12 prunes) a day for a year  and a control group did not eat any prunes.Researchers, who took blood samples from the women before and after the study, discovered a significant reduction in inflammatory markers in both groups of prune-eating women compared to the control group.“Our findings suggest that consumption of six to 12 prunes per day may reduce pro-inflammatory mediators that may contribute to bone loss in postmenopausal women,” said Janhavi Damani, the first author of the study. “Thus, prunes might be a promising nutritional intervention to prevent the rise in inflammatory mediators often observed as part of the aging process.”Dave Yasvinski is a writer with Healthing.ca;Prunes may have another health benefit: reducing the risk of osteoporosisEating six to 12 prunes each day may help lower the inflammation that causes bone loss in post-menopausal women.While osteoporosis has long been attributed to endocrine, metabolic and mechanical factors, this more recent study suggests inflammation plays a key role in bone turnover .Osteoporosis is often referred to as “the silent thief” because bones lose their density slowly over the years without presenting any obvious symptoms.As adults age, the natural process that replaces old bones becomes less effective, resulting in a loss of bone tissue.The first group was required to eat 50 grams (about six prunes) a day for a year  the second ate 100 grams (about 12 prunes) a day for a year  and a control group did not eat any prunes.;['health', 'inflammation', 'benefit', 'reducing', 'inflammatory', 'osteoporosis', 'postmenopausal', 'prunes', 'study', 'women', 'risk', 'loss', 'bone', 'day'];0.1321590909090909;positive
National Post;SHIFT: When it comes to what to say to someone who is grieving, there are no words;SHIFT: When it comes to what to say to someone who is grieving, there are no wordsSometimes the most helpful thing to say someone who is grieving, whether it be the loss of a loved one, their health or a job, is nothing at all.There’s this store near where I live that sells a lot of feel-good things.From pillows with maps of the lakey bliss of Muskoka and coat hooks in the shape of birds, to cheeky door mats ( If you aren’t a dog, don’t bother knocking ) and small decorative wooden signs that you stick into plants (the one that says I wet my plants is my favourite).It’s the perfect place to mull around in when you’re feeling bummed — also my first destination when I am looking for a little something for a friend who needs a boost.I was there this week, breathing in summer scents of citronella candles and hyacinth sprouts, looking for a gift for a sweet friend whose 55-year-old husband just passed away from pancreatic cancer. A wonderful guy, a great dad to three beautiful kids, a devoted husband, a big believer in philanthropy — from the hundreds of people who lined up to pay their respects, it was easy to see that his life had touched many and his loss was felt far and wide.And if you know anything about this insidious, ruthless type of cancer, it’s fast and unforgiving most of the time. I can only imagine the blur the last eight months have been for his family, and how it must feel now — that awful hollow feeling that comes when a person you love is there and then suddenly not.ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementIt took me awhile to settle on a small plant — a jade, which is symbolic of luck and renewal. The colour of the pot it sat in matched my friend’s living room perfectly.When bad things happen, it’s hard to find the right words to sayI struggled with finding a card too. “In deepest sympathy” sounded too stiff, “Thinking of you,” was a little too trite, and then there was the one about lemons and making lemonade, and well, I’m not sure who thought that was a good add to the sympathy card section. I spent almost an hour trying to find one that said exactly what I felt — but of course, nothing came close.It’s not just death that leaves us scrambling to find ways to express our sorrow and support that feel like enough. A painful divorce, a scary diagnosis, the illness of a child, even the loss of a job — when bad things happen, it’s hard to find the right words to say.ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementHow do you comfort someone who has received a terminal diagnosis? Or whose true love has left them for someone else? Or whose wife has had to move into long-term care? Words just never feel quite right.And when we do take a shot at saying something, we desperately hope we don’t say the wrong thing.See More +A friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago had a “What Not To Say To Someone Who Has Cancer” list that she either laughed about or simmered over depending on how she was feeling. At the top of the list was, “Everything happens for a reason,” with “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger” coming in at a close second. When a neighbour told her that he would pray for her, she joked that what he really meant to say was, “I hope someone will help you other than me.”On HelpGuide , a website that provides free mental health support, authors Melinda Smith, Lawrence Robinson, and Jeanne Segal list other things to avoid saying to someone who is grieving, such as, “It’s part of God’s plan,” and “Look at what you have to be thankful for.” Instead, they suggest using words of acknowledgement that show you are open to talking about it, like “I heard your sister died,” and “Do you feel like talking?”ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementSmith, Robinson and Segal also talk about making space for them to tell their story which helps to lessen the pain. Be honest if you don’t know what to say, and also be willing to be silent, offering no words, but instead, a hug or a touch on the arm.Stories can help with the sadnessBeing on the “losing” end of things a few times in the last few years, I have watched those around me struggle with trying to find the “right” things to say and others who avoided the conversation altogether. One of the things I found most helpful when I lost my dad and brother was hearing stories about them — how they touched the lives of others helped me feel connected to them. And when I was faced with figuring out how to live with cancer, normal conversations about diapers and dogs, and deliveries of chocolate and wine were welcome — it didn’t take away my fear, but the moments of normalcy helped me escape it for awhile.ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementAnd yet, though I know all of this in my heart, instead of knocking on my friend’s door, I left my little green token of support in its fancy bag on her doorstep behind an enormous planter. It still had Christmas ribbon tied around tired brown sprigs of evergreen — a sign of how consuming the last few months must have been for her, someone who prided herself on keeping up with the seasons.I didn’t knock because I worried about intruding, or that I would cry and make her more sad, or that maybe she wasn’t up to visitors (which, of course, if this was the case, she just wouldn’t answer the door). But when I got to the sidewalk, I turned around, went back and rang the doorbell. She wasn’t home, but I had the chance to talk to her sons briefly about their dad — with tears — but also about their new puppy, school and how much they had grown. Their faces were pale and tired, but there seemed to be some relief in stepping away from their grief for awhile.ADVERTISEMENT AdvertisementStill though, it felt like there was more that could have been said. And yet, words also seemed useless.Perhaps Noble prize-winning author Toni Morrison said it best when she was asked about mourning the death of her youngest son, Slade, who also died of pancreatic cancer at age 45.“What do you say? There really are no words for that. There really aren’t,” she said. “Somebody tries to say, ‘I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,'” she told The Guardian . “People say that to me. There’s no language for it. Sorry doesn’t do it. I think you should just hug people and mop their floor or something.”The hug for my friend didn’t come until the funeral, and though all she could muster was, “I just gotta keep breathing,” that I was able to hold her up when she leaned into me said more than anything I could have communicated with words.For my friend: you wouldn’t want me to mop your floors — I’m terrible at it — but I’m here for hugs.

RH975 and RH1250S models.”Talk about good detective work. Motorcycle.com, experts at combing Internet “mouse copy” for clues about upcoming new models, has done it again with “confirmation” the next version of Harley-Davidson’s iconic Sportster will feature a 975-cc version of its acclaimed Revolution Max V-twin.This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThis is the clearest indication yet the next iteration of Harley’s icon — which the company has been teasing for weeks — will be powered by a 975-cc version of the 60-degree double-overhead-cam four-valve V-twin that powers the bigger Sportster, as well as the company’s acclaimed Pan America adventure tourer.Chung further deduces that, because the new model lacks the “S” designation, it will be a lower-performance version of the iconic Sportster. Indeed, teaser photos seem to indicate traditional twin rear shocks and just a single disc brake at the front wheel.He also contends the reveal may happen as soon as tomorrow, because Harley has already trademarked the name “Nightster,” and he notes that if you Google that name, the most prominent result is the landing page for a April 12 announcement on Harley’s corporate website.

Try refreshing your browser, or What happens when you hit a pothole? Back to video Pothole season has arrived across the country. Reporting from Sudbury, Ontario, I can confirm a familiar story: our roads and highways are disintegrating beneath us like dollar-store toilet paper, and motorists are paying the price. Potholes come in many shapes and sizes, and hitting the wrong one the wrong way can cause catastrophic damage to your car or truck. As an added bonus, current global supply chain issues may wreak havoc with tire and parts availability, adding further frustration to the mix. Below, lets cover some pothole basics including the types of damage they cause, the consequences of not taking that damage seriously, and some common terms and part names that’ll come in handy if you’re headed to the shop after losing a battle with a tooth-rattling pavement chasm.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Watch: What happens to your suspension when you hit a pothole Pothole season has returned to Toronto How potholes harm your ride The sort of damage your car can suffer from a pothole strike is wide-reaching. In some cases, a pothole strike will bend or break a wheel rim, split or puncture a tire causing outright failure, and / or cause collateral damage to other parts related to your car’s steering, suspension, and perhaps especially front-end. Sometimes, when you hit the sort of pothole that’d make your grandmother curse, you’ll lose a tire or wheel straight away. Other times, damage may be inflicted that surfaces later on, such as damage to a tire’s inner sidewall that weakens that tire and leaves it vulnerable to a dangerous blow-out in a subsequent strike.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Pothole strikes can hurt your vehicle’s alignment, too. When the alignment is out of whack, your car’s steering may perform poorly, and it’ll probably handle like a piece of soggy toast. Large pothole in Montreal, Quebec. What is an alignment? Having an alignment performed on your car is like getting an adjustment at the chiropractor. The goal is to ensure an optimal physical arrangement of wheels and vital suspension parts. Keeping your back healthy is important, and keeping your car’s alignment heathy is important too. When your car’s alignment is off, it’ll handle poorly, wear out its tires more quickly, waste fuel needlessly, cost you more money to operate, and be less enjoyable to drive. When a professional gives your car an alignment, they’re making precise physical adjustments to steering and suspension components beneath your vehicle, with the goal of restoring the physical geometry of your car’s suspension and steering system back to factory settings. This affects how the tires contact the road, and ultimately the handling, safety, comfort, and efficiency of the vehicle.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by LightFieldStudios / Getty What is a tire balance? A tire balance is different than an alignment. With an alignment, your vehicle’s suspension geometry is set to an optimal configuration that ensures your tires contact the road just right. With a tire balance, the work performed involves making sure the wheels roll down the road smoothly, free from unwanted vibrations. If you’ve ever heard your washing machine thumping itself to pieces from the laundry room while trying to spin-dry a single, heavy item, you’re familiar with why tires and wheels may require balancing: uneven weight distribution. In the laundry room, unwanted washer vibrations are fixed by rearranging your soggy comforter so your Maytag spins away more smoothly. On your car, correcting imbalance requires wheels and tires to be mounted on a special machine that detects and measures vibrations. Technicians can add small counterweights at strategic parts of the wheel to offset these vibrations, ensuring your newly installed tires roll down the road in silky-smooth fashion — hopefully, not straight into another pothole.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Often, alignments and wheel balancing are done at the same time. Note that a tire rotation is a completely different procedure, in which your vehicle’s tires and wheels are swapped into different corners of the car, to help evenly distribute wear. THey’re easy to mix up, but tires aren’t wheels, and wheels aren’t tires. Tires are made of rubber, and wrap around the car’s wheels, which are made of metal. Potholes can cause damage to tires, wheels, or both. Check your spare If potholes are rapidly spreading in your locale, be sure your spare tire situation is properly sorted to avoid unpleasant surprises. After all, nothing ruins a Sunday drive more than finding out you’ve got a flat spare or a defective tire inflator kit after a game of ‘Puddle or Pothole?’ turns one of your wheels into an octagon.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Whatever spare tire provisions are included in your ride, you’ll want to make sure they’re tip-top and ready to go before you need them. Photo by Getty What to do and what to expect after a pothole strike Since potholes can cause immediate problems, or surprise issues later on, it’s important to be on the lookout for signs of trouble and damage during and after pothole season. Inspect your tires regularly, on both inner and outer sidewall surfaces, for signs of gouges, lumps or other damage. Anything unusual should be inspected professionally if detected. Monitor tire inflation pressure regularly, as even a slow leak may be a sign of a hairline crack in your wheel rim. This also benefits everyday efficiency and handling. Pay attention to the way your car feels and sounds, remembering that if anything seems off, it probably is. If in doubt, get that car checked out by a professional.Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content I asked some experts at OK tire to tell me about the most commonly reported signs and symptoms of pothole related damage, among customers arriving for pothole damage. According to OK Tire, these customers typically report unusual vibrations or sounds, poor handling, bent rims, cracked rims (which can invite pressure loss or blowouts), structural tire damage and torn sidewalls, and broken or damaged components like ball joints, struts, and shocks. Photo by Getty What are ball joints? Struts? Shocks? Bushings? A ball joint is like a human hip-joint: basically, a ball-in-socket style joint that allows the parts connected to it to move, bend, and pivot against one another. If you live in a pothole-riddled town or city, your car’s ball joints take quite a beating, and will eventually wear out and require replacement.Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Sometimes, ball joints are built into other larger suspension components. Other times, they can be changed on their own. Like an achy hip, ball joints often provide advanced warning of trouble. This usually presents as a knocking, clunking, or tapping sound as you drive down the road. Ever see a car pulled onto the shoulder with its front wheels facing away from one another, while the driver waits for the tow-truck? That’s what happens if you ignore the signs of a bad ball joint. Struts (also known as shocks) control the bounce of your vehicle’s springs. Your car or truck has one or more of these at each corner, and they’re crucial to its suspension system — the hardware that makes your car ride how it rides. Struts can be damaged or obliterated by a severe pothole strike, which can result in visible fluid leaks, a noisy ride, excessive harshness or bouncing, and terrible handling.Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Bushings are like your cartilage — squishy, slippery bits of connective tissue that allow our bones and joints to smoothly slip and bend at key locations. In your Grand Cherokee, bushings are like rubber tubes and donuts made of things like urethane and rubber, and they’re installed to cushion suspension parts from one another, enabling a smooth and quiet ride. Bushings may be torn or otherwise damaged by potholes, or required while replacing other larger components damaged by a pothole strike. Failed bushings usually present with harsh knocking sounds and sensations. Photo by Getty The best tip to avoid potholes The best way to protect yourself from pothole-related trauma is to make sure you see them coming. If you’re a fan of tailgating, you’re at a significantly increased risk of hitting a pothole, since you’ve got a limited view of the road surface ahead of your car. Instead of tailgating, maintain and defend a 2 or 3 car-length gap in traffic. There are a multitude of reasons this is a good idea, and in pothole season, one of those is the added ability to see incoming potholes while you’ve got time to react to them. Assuming every puddle contains a crater big enough to swallow a piece of agricultural equipment is a great way to avoid losing a wheel, too.Share this article in your social network;Try refreshing your browser, or What happens when you hit a pothole?Article content More On This Topic Watch: What happens to your suspension when you hit a pothole Pothole season has returned to Toronto How potholes harm your ride The sort of damage your car can suffer from a pothole strike is wide-reaching.Sometimes, when you hit the sort of pothole that’d make your grandmother curse, you’ll lose a tire or wheel straight away.Article content Pothole strikes can hurt your vehicle’s alignment, too.Article content I asked some experts at OK tire to tell me about the most commonly reported signs and symptoms of pothole related damage, among customers arriving for pothole damage.;['tires', 'happens', 'content', 'article', 'hit', 'damage', 'wheels', 'pothole', 'loaded', 'car', 'continues', 'tire'];0.05788018935500951;neutral

Try refreshing your browser, or Vancouver proposes 10,000-dollar annual fee for gas stations without EV charging Back to video The proposal is aimed at speeding up the rollout of EV charging stations across the city in the hopes of encouraging more people to buy electric vehicles. “There would be an incentive to invest in EV charging to avoid the higher annual license fee,” staff wrote in the report. Businesses would have to make charging stations available in 2025 to avoid the increased license fee. Currently, the cost of a business license is $263 for a gas station and $163 for parking lots. Gas stations would be required to provide 50 kilowatts of charging power — enough for one DC fast charger. Parking lots would have to provide at least 26.6 kilowatts, which would be enough for four Level 2 chargers, which typically provide 20-50 kilometres per hour of charging. Parking lots with less than 60 stalls would be exempt.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Limited charging options for electric vehicles remains a significant barrier to EV adoption, according to a 2021 survey of 12,000 Vancouver residents conducted for the city. Nearly 40 per cent of Vancouver’s CO2 emissions come from vehicles. More On This Topic Motor Mouth: How many EV charging stations will we really need? Explained: EV charging levels for beginners City staff estimated the cost to install the required charging stations would be $136,000 for gas stations and $100,000 for parking lots. Businesses could be expected to recoup those costs in seven or eight years, according to staff estimates. That upfront cost was cited as a major barrier by many business owners in communications with city staff. Dr. Werner Antweiler, a professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business who studies electric vehicles, said the price of charging stations isn’t likely to come down any time soon.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In an interview earlier this year, Antweiler said that unlike batteries, where new technology is expected to bring the cost down over time, with chargers there is “no potential to make them cheaper other than maybe introducing greater scale.” Most of the costs, he said, are “installation and labour.” Businesses would keep all the revenue generated from the charging stations, according to the city’s proposal, in addition to earning credits from the province’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard from selling electricity through the chargers. The proposal notes that the provincial government’s commitment to strengthening the credit would “greatly improve the business case” for EV charging. Photo by Andrew McCredie Responses from an online survey of stakeholders conducted by the city noted that space constraints, a lack of power and limited demand at certain locations were all issues the city should be considering when setting higher license fees. Supply chain issues were also cited as a significant concern, with many respondents believing they would need “more time than two years” to get chargers installed, city staff wrote in the proposal.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Modelling provided to the city estimated that about 30 per cent of gas stations and 40 per cent of parking lots would install chargers by 2030, adding roughly 100 charging stations across the city. It also estimated $1.7 million in revenues for the city from the increased license fees. According to city staff, the policy is not intended as a revenue source but to “encourage private investments in EV infrastructure.” Revenue generated from the program would be used for funding climate initiatives outlined in the city’s climate action plan, such as adding charging stations to rental buildings.

Its sharp tetragonal crystals shone with a dull gold-like lustre, but even a fool could tell this wasn’t gold.

Try refreshing your browser, or Long-term test: Winter road-tripping the Mitsubishi Mirage to the Sudbury Superstack Back to video The area that we now know as Greater Sudbury was settled by the Ojibwe people some 9,000 years ago, its rich forests and many lakes feeding and clothing the indigenes for many generations. When French Jesuit missionaries became the first white settlers to the area in 1874, they named the place Sainte-Anne-de-Pins for its pine-covered landscape. But the area remained sparsely settled until 1883, when ore was discovered during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad through the area. Along the 385-km drive from Toronto to Sudbury up Ontario Highway 400 and the Trans Canada Highway, you can still see some snippets of what the land used to look like. In the spaces in between the towns and gas stations, and where you can’t see power lines or railroad tracks, the rugged Canadian Shield still looks as beautifully impenetrable as ever. Somewhat less massive than the huge blocks of pink granite that framed the road cuts was our Mitsubishi Mirage long-term test car.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content We wanted to put our spunky half-pint long-termer to the test of a Canadian winter road trip. Our test Mirage is the base ES Manual trim. It retails for $14,098, and as name implies, has a 5-speed manual transmission. It’s the most affordable car in the Mitsubishi lineup, and with the departure of the $10,398 Chevy Spark, it will soon be the most affordable new car in Canada. We’ve published a long-term test intro, and we recently pit it up against the used-car market. The spindly Mirage is the lightest car you can buy new in Canada at some 2,095 pounds, and it feels like it as it wisps down the highway. Though its aerodynamic teardrop-shaped roofline is actually patented, it only seems to slip through wind that comes at it from the forward direction, and it gets blown about quite easily by side winds. Nor do you just feel the wind — you hear it, too. That low weight figure which pays dividends for handling and fuel economy was partially accomplished by a relative lack of sound deadening.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Toggle full screen mode Previous Gallery Image Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Photo by Elliot Alder Next Gallery Image Toggle gallery captions All 10 Photos for Gallery Function Not Available Full Screen is not supported on this browser version.

By 1929 Sudbury had become one of the world’s leading producers of nickel, and the area had two 500-ft smokestacks that belched the black, sooty byproducts of nickel mining into the atmosphere to shower back down on the city and surrounding area. Sudbury was one of the fastest-growing cities in the 1930s, and it recovered quickly from the Great Depression. This growth came at a cost, however: mountainous tailings piles, black and barren of trees, grew near the Inco mining facility. Across the area, soot and acid rain stained the local granite black as coal, sometimes penetrating up to three inches deep in the rock. A strategy of higher-altitude dispersion was adopted, and in 1972 the Inco Superstack was completed.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content More On This Topic Car Review: 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage Long-term test update: 2022 Mitsubishi Mirage vs the Used Car Market As we breezed into Sudbury, the looming Superstack came into view. Standing 381 meters tall, the Superstack stands more than four times the height of the Statue of Liberty and as tall as the Empire State Building. When it was completed in 1972, the Superstack was the tallest smokestack in the world, and even today it is only topped by the GRES-2 smokestack in Kazakhstan. The intention was not so much to reduce pollution, but to disperse it over a wider area so as to less affect the city. The stack looms tall over the Mitsubishi. Parked in the neighborhood of Copper Cliff — where people literally live in the shadow of the Superstack — some houses stand fewer than 300 meters from the base of the mighty tower. The single 1.75-inch diameter tailpipe of the Mirage trembles at idle, seemingly in fear of its infinitely larger counterpart.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Far from a gross polluter, the Mirage is one of the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid vehicles in Canada. A manual-transmission model like ours is rated to return 5.8 L/100 km on the highway, and the CVT model is even more thrifty at 5.6 L/100 km. On paper this beats out almost all other small cars, but there is a catch: the Mirage is a small car powered by a small 1.2L engine. It only makes 78 hp, and in our testing we found it to be most efficient around 90 to 105 km/h. The Mirage has enough power to cruise as fast as you please on public highway, but pushing the needle past 115 km/h will cause economy to suffer simply because that little three-cylinder is working! With an average speed of around 120 km/h, our test economy was 6.3 L/100km. Still impressive, but not that much better than a 2021 Honda Civic, which would return 6.5 L/100 km on paper and could likely do so at higher speeds than the Mitsu. The Mirage is best suited for city life, but it can be pushed into road-trip duty in a pinch.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Photo by Elliot Alder The Superstack is a controversial icon for the city. It is a towering testimony to the hard work that built the city, but it is also a looming reminder of the darker side of exploiting the Earth’s resources. Some wish to see it preserved as a monument to the city’s history  others see it as a blight that should be removed from the horizon. Officially decommissioned in July 2020, it today stands dormant. Vale (which owns the facility) has announced that the Superstack will be demolished in the coming years, but has not given an exact timeframe. The Superstack will eventually vanish from the landscape, and as we zip home in the little Mitsu I likewise wonder how much longer this type of car will be around. We’ve lost the Fiesta, Micra, Fit, Yaris, and soon the Spark. Once a Canadian staple, basic and affordable hatchbacks are being usurped by hybrids and CUV lookalikes such as the Kicks and Ecosport. Despite this, Mirage sales are strong and the company has no plans of axing the model.Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content As we park the Mirage underneath the famous Sudbury Big Nickel, we can see out over the tailings piles at the Vale facility. Newly planted trees have taken root, and a stubble of pine has been forming. As the snow melts, patches of scrubby grass can be seen poking out of the slush. Beneath a sky once permanently clouded by the sulfur dioxide of the 1970s and ’80s, the macabre Superstack seems increasingly out of place among the greenery. The world progresses constantly, and things we think will stay with us forever have a way of quietly disappearing.

Based on the 11th-generation Civic, the new subcompact SUV has a longer and wider stance than the outgoing model, and a generally flattened appearance, which is a visual upgrade as far as we can tell. Other notable changes include the grille, which is now larger and more oval, and the rear door handles, which have been moved from their window-adjacent positioning and put back in their traditional spot. Honda hasn’t mentioned engine details other than the “HR-V will feature a more responsive engine and a new independent rear suspension, giving the compact SUV a more confident, refined and fun-to-drive personality.”Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content B.C. cyclist gets ICBC bill after being struck by vehicle Photo by Jason Payne / Postmedia A B.C. cyclist who was struck and badly injured by a vehicle last summer says he was shocked to receive a letter from provincial insurer ICBC claiming he would be on the hook for $3,752.01 in vehicle repairs. Ben Bollinger says a driver ran a stop sign in downtown Vancouver last summer and struck him while he was on his bicycle, causing him to miss months of work. ICBC’s position — likely due to a recently implemented no-fault insurance policy — is that Bollinger was “driving an uninsured vehicle at the time of the loss…mean[ing] you do not have insurance coverage for this loss and must repay the cost of our insured’s claim.” In light of recent media coverage, however, it seems ICBC might be changing its tune.

Rumours of Ram eyeing unibody pickup truck to compete with Ford Maverick Photo by Ram Truck fans this week grabbed hold of a rumour published by South American publication Auto Segredos regarding a potential small Ram pickup. Yeah, that’s a rumour we’re happy to propagate! Allegedly, a Stellantis suit name dropped a “Ram 1200” in the works that could feature an electrified hybrid powertrain. Is this the “new midsize truck” Stellantis teased at its EV Day in 2021, something different, or nothing at all? Should it arrive in North America, the baby Ram would compete directly against the Blue Oval’s well-received unibody Maverick.

Try refreshing your browser, or This war vet fought fires for 12 years. Then his city fired him over medical cannabis Back to video An Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Martin joined the Buffalo Fire Department in 2009 and was eventually assigned to a truck and platoon that covered his childhood neighbourhood. For nearly 12 years he worked at one of the busiest firehouses in the city and was an exemplary employee until a random drug test, 10 days before Christmas, revealed cannabis in his system. New York state legalized medical cannabis in 2014 and Martin qualified as a patient due to a back injury that didn’t respond well to a variety of other treatments, including opioids, nerve blockers and X-ray-assisted spinal injections. Martin knew he would test positive for cannabis and provided his employer with his prescription before the results came in. A week after the test, though, Martin was suspended without pay and ordered to enter a program for substance use.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Martin completed the program and then tested positive for cannabis again in February, as he continued to follow his doctor-recommended treatment plan. He was then fired under the terms of the union’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which prohibits cannabis. The CBA was last updated in 2011, three years before the state legalized medical cannabis. “I had always wanted to be a firefighter. That was my purpose in life,” Martin tells The GrowthOp on a video call from his home in New York state. “And then just to lose everything like that was just… it was a shock. But I’ve been working through it and I’m doing better every day.” More On This Topic Ontario cannabis fellowship encourages people affected by prohibition to apply After a career in the NFL 'destroyed' his health, Eben Britton found a new purpose in cannabis Myth vs. fact: Documentary project led by McGill prof examines cannabis and mental healthAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content In May of last year, Martin filed a lawsuit against the City of Buffalo and the Buffalo Fire Department. He is seeking full reinstatement and to be reassigned back to his original rank and platoon. “They’re trying to say that I’m unsafe and that I can’t do my job,” Martin says. “Yet, I’ve never had any issues with anyone saying I can’t do my job and I work in one of the busiest houses in the city and I’ve worked there the majority of my career.” Martin says he consumes cannabis in the evenings to help ease his back pain before bed and to mitigate symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While he originally sought a cannabis prescription for his back, he said it has also been effective in treating the condition. “That’s just an added bonus,” he says.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Before he started consuming cannabis, Martin was taking opiates and painkillers that led to stomach issues, left him restless and made it harder to fall asleep. He was also drinking, and after his doctor warned him about the damage he was doing to his body by consuming alcohol while also taking a number of pain pills, he decided to look into cannabis. “My pain management doctor was telling me that I was probably going to kill myself if I continued drinking,” he says. “The man probably saved my life. He told me to try [cannabis] and I actually had really good results.” It took some trial and error, he adds, but eventually, he figured out the right doses and cannabinoids that benefited him most. “Once I got it dialed in, I wasn’t having all my issues,” he says. “I wasn’t as anxious. I used to be covered in sweat when I woke up in the morning and that went away.”Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content He adds that while medical cannabis may not be an option for everyone, for him it has proven to be “a game-changer.” ‘We are going to win this case’ Martin is represented in the case by David C. Holland, principal of The Law Offices of David Clifford Holland P.C. Holland says that when the state legalized medical cannabis with the Compassionate Care Act in 2014, it had extremely restrictive criteria to qualify for the program. Still, Martin pursued it under the guidance of his doctor and was approved. Once a patient qualifies for the program, they are deemed disabled under the law, and employers are required to make accommodations, Holland says. “The problem is that the drug policy for medical marijuana has not been updated since 2011,” he says. “There was no medical marijuana in 2011. And there’s still no medical marijuana exception in the collective bargaining agreement.”Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Scott followed exactly what he’s required to do under the collective bargaining agreement, and they still wouldn’t treat him like how they would if he were an opioid patient,” he adds. Photo by submitted Holland said that during the course of this case, it was revealed the city considered adding an exemption for medical cannabis patients in 2018 but decided against it unless they received concessions in other areas. “The position of the City of Buffalo right now is that they’re able to collectively bargain away that disability status,” Holland says, adding that certain rights can be bargained away, such as what is said within the confines of a workplace or on social media after work hours, but not disability status. “You’ve not ever been able to dispense in a collective bargaining agreement with race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality,” he says. “Disabilities are not something that can be bargained away and Scott’s status as a disabled person could not be bargained away. And that’s pretty clear when you look at the history of the statute and why they passed it. So the city’s problem is they want to rationalize discrimination against a disabled person. Effectively, that’s what they’re doing. They don’t want to make any accommodation.”Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The city is arguing that unions have the right to “waive individual employee’s rights in order to secure the greater good of its members as a whole as well as of the citizens its members serve.” “Our children are caught in attics during fires, desperately needing the timely, un-slowed responses of physically fit and qualified firefighters. Our parents, suffering cardiac arrest, desperately need the quick and un-slowed ministrations of Department members. Our firefighters, entering burning structures, deserve to work safely alongside their co-workers,” the city argues in court documents obtained by The GrowthOp. “At what point does the individualistic preference of a sole member — re-framed by Scott Martin as a ‘right’ and even ‘disability’ — trump the crying need of our community to fully qualified first responders, unaffected by substances?”Advertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Holland says that Martin simply wants to continue his medical cannabis treatment because it has proven effective, while traditional treatments have offered significant side effects with little relief. “He doesn’t take it to work with him. He doesn’t show up impaired. He’s not been a danger to his fellow firefighters, or to those people he rescues on a daily basis,” Holland says. “He’s an exemplary employee, and that’s what needs to be taken into account. Here’s a guy that put his life on the line for his country overseas in combat and he puts his line on life every day for people in Buffalo. How can you not make a reasonable small accommodation?” Holland suspects that whatever the outcome is of the current case, it will likely move on to the next court.Advertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “We’ll just keep going. I will not back down from this fight. Not for a guy like Scott. He deserves better respect than he’s getting,” Holland says. “We will take it to New York State’s highest court. And we’ll go to the United States Supreme Court if we have to. But we are going to win this case, without any question.” For Martin, he says that he never suspected he was doing anything wrong since every process was above board and under the guidance of a qualified medical professional. Now off work for 16 months, Martin says he has struggled to find another job that won’t risk further injury. Despite his skills and experience, he doesn’t have certifications or degrees to back it up. “I can’t really find any work where I wouldn’t be doing manual labour, making like 17 bucks an hour, hoping I don’t get hurt,” he says.Advertisement 11 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Due to the length of the still ongoing case, he has had time to apply for his veteran benefits, something he had previously neglected to do since he was working his dream job, he says. “I never applied for my veteran’s benefits for my issues because I never thought I deserved them. I was gainfully employed. I thought they were there for guys who came back and weren’t able to find work. But since the city decided I’m not employable anymore, I actually filed for my VA benefits,” he says, adding that he’s now receiving them. In the meantime, he’s also continuing to take medical cannabis. “I still have my medical card, I haven’t stopped. I did nothing wrong. I’m legally allowed to use this. And even if I didn’t have my medical card, now it’s legal in New York state.” He adds that he pays for his cannabis out of pocket while his previous treatments were covered by his employer. “I literally saved the city money by doing this. They were having to pay before to get the injections into my spine and I’m sure that wasn’t cheap,” he says. “So it just doesn’t make any sense. It’s a win-win situation all around. And it’s just like they can’t accept it, you know?” Subscribe to Weekend Dispensary, a weekly newsletter from The GrowthOp.Share this article in your social networkLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Weekend Dispensary Sign-up for Weekend Dispensary to get the latest cannabis news and exclusive articles delivered straight to your inbox.

Photo by wildpixel / iStock / Getty Images PlusArticle content It’s good to share until it’s not. That’s what staff and students at a New Mexico elementary school learned after a child shared THC-infused cannabis edibles with 14 other pupils.Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content According to News Nation, it was not announced how the student accessed the candies, or if the pupil knew what they contained. “Like any other school system in New Mexico, we will have to grapple with educating our families, children, and staff on what to look for and how to provide safe environments for our children under this new era of legalization,” the statement notes. Per information from Marijuana Policy Project, adult-use cannabis became legal on June 29, 2021 and retail sales kicked off on Apr. 1 allowing New Mexicans 21 and older to legally buy weed from a licensed retail store — as well as their previous ability to possess as much as 56 grams of weed and to cultivate up to six mature and six immature cannabis plants (the maximum per household is 12 plants).Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Allowable weed purchases include up to 800 milligrams of edible cannabis. Canadian research published in Clinical Toxicology in 2021 showed that cannabis-related poisonings among children rose in the periods just before and after recreational weed was legalized. In the summer of 2020, Health Canada issued an advisory reminding parents to carefully store cannabis edibles. It was released in the wake of several children being hospitalized after ingesting illegal weed edibles — all of which were stored in places like fridges or freezers and did not have the childproof packaging required on legal cannabis edibles — that looked like regular treats. According to the Ontario Poison Centre, “The effects of cannabis in a child are much more variable than effects seen in adults. Any ingestion of cannabis in a child can cause serious harm.” Subscribe to Weekend Dispensary, a new weekly newsletter from The GrowthOp.Share this article in your social networkLatest National Stories Advertisement 1 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Weekend Dispensary Sign-up for Weekend Dispensary to get the latest cannabis news and exclusive articles delivered straight to your inbox.

The 50-year-old was taken from his California home and found dead several hours later. Photo by InstagramArticle content Some argue it was a botched robbery attempt  others say the act was premeditated murder. Whatever may be the reason, the specifics of why and how Tushar Atre was killed still remain unknown.Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content The resulting confrontation ended with Atre being stabbed, forced into his girlfriend’s car, and then driven away. His body was found near “the 2008 BMW associated with the case” hours later, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office (SCCSO) reported after the incident. Per CBS News, Atre had been stabbed and fatally shot on his cannabis farm located in the nearby Santa Cruz Mountains. There was blood on the car and his body was discovered an estimated 20 to 30 metres away. The coroner ruled Atre’s death a homicide from a gunshot wound. Who was Tushar Atre? The son of Indian immigrants had come to California from the east coast more than two decades earlier, Inc. reports. Although his degree in literature from New York University may not have easily predicted his work path, Atre became the CEO of digital marketing firm AtreNet Inc. and owner of Interstitial Systems, Ltd., a cannabis company in California, according to Heavy.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content “Tushar was clever, creative and hardworking in every area of his life, both professionally and personally,” the AtreNet website reports. “He was an avid surfer, mountain biker, guitarist and craftsman,” it notes, adding that he “pushed others to think and act differently — to do better and to always strive for more.” Photo by Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office Atre founded AtreNet in 1996 with a clear mission: “Do whatever it takes to ensure customers are successful with purpose-built, beautiful web experiences that convey what sets them apart from others.” According to Inc., Atre’s focus had shifted more to the cannabis startup by the fall of 2019. He had reportedly spent a million-plus dollars of his own money on the new venture and had raised millions of dollars more from investors.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content What did house guests hear? After hearing a commotion and a vehicle speeding away, one of the guests in the home phoned 9-1-1. “We believe this was a robbery for monetary value,” Santa Cruz Sheriff Lt. Brian Cleveland said at the time, according to CBS affiliate KPIX 5, a view reflected in an SCCSO statement on Oct. 2, 2019. The take from the entire incident was about approx. $37,000 in cash, a camera and an acoustic guitar, Inc. cites evidence presented in a preliminary hearing as noting. According to CBS, investigators reported that Atre had approx. $100,000 in his bedroom safe, but the suspects were unable to open it. About six weeks following the murder, the SCCSO released a neighbour’s home surveillance video of the suspects and asked for the public’s help in identifying them. The video shows the man, whose hands were tied behind his back with plastic ties, escaping from the home, only to be taken down and shoved into an SUV that pulls up beside the perpetrators, per Inc.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content There were reportedly four contractors staying in guest suites semi-private from the main home at the time of the incident. One person reportedly told officers someone was heard shouting, “Open the safe,” as well as “Where is it?” and “Where are they?” A reward of approx. $187,000, which was provided by private community members, was offered for information received no later than Dec. 30, 2019 “that leads to the arrest and conviction of the suspect(s) involved in the crimes.” An eight-month investigation, in which police narrowed a pool of 3,000 potential suspects to four, ended with identifying the suspects, who at the time were aged 19 to 23. Two men were arrested in Santa Cruz, while the other two were extradited back to California after being arrested in Michigan. At the time of the arrest, all four men faced charges of robbing, kidnapping and murdering Atre.Advertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Why go to the cultivation site? Following the arrests of the suspects last year, Merry Jane reported the suspects may have believed there was money at the cultivation site. Despite medical marijuana being sold legally in about two-thirds of U.S. states and recreational cannabis in approximately a third, “it’s still illegal on a federal level, meaning most banks won’t service the industry in case they fall afoul of money laundering laws,” according to Reuters. That makes legal weed a mostly cash business, particularly for smaller players unable to afford unmarked armoured vans to regularly transport their cash, the article suggests. In California, it was not until Feb. 1, 2021 that “licensed cannabis businesses in California gained another avenue, albeit narrow, to secure financial services,” notes an article by JD Supra. Emergency regulations on information sharing with financial institutions now mean they “can provide their services to licensed cannabis businesses without penalty under California law,” the article reports.Advertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content What happens next with the case? According to a Facebook group, Justice for Tushar Atre, the next court proceeding will take place on May 6. “This is the date where the court can and usually will set the case for trial. With each passing day we approach the day of justice,” a post from Mar. 13 reads. The Mercury News reports that all four accused have been indicted on seven counts, including carjacking, first-degree burglary, kidnapping, kidnapping to commit another crime, second-degree robbery, first-degree residential robbery, plus special allegations of robbery and kidnapping during the commission of a murder.

The arrest is certainly not the first time a senior has been busted for suspected cannabis. This past January, 15 kilograms of weed was found hidden behind a false wall in a U.K. home, which police discovered after earlier busting a 65-year-old man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. In October of 2021 in Ontario, a 70-year-old man was charged with impaired operation of a vehicle after a concerned citizen noticed a still-running, but not moving, vehicle in downtown Brantford. Upon rousing the sleeping driver, responding officers saw drug paraphernalia in clear view inside the vehicle.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Almost a year earlier in December 2020, an 81-year-old man faced charges under the Cannabis Act and the Criminal Code of Canada after police say their search revealed suspected cocaine and cannabis with an estimated street value of about $29,000 and more than $11,000 in cash. The Trinidad and Tobago bust isn’t even the first time that illegal cannabis was found in a barrel. A Guyanese husband and wife were arrested in early January 2021 after police found several large parcels of cannabis leaves, seeds and stems weighing more than four kilograms stashed inside a garbage bag hidden in a blue plastic barrel.

CNN;Opinión: Viendo el mundo a través de los ojos de Vladimir Putin;"'Putin es un asesino', dice un guardameta ucraniano 1:36Nota del editor: Douglas London es el autor de ""El reclutador: el espionaje y el arte perdido de la inteligencia estadounidense"". Es profesor de Estudios de Inteligencia en la Escuela de Servicio Exterior de la Universidad de Georgetown y es académico no residente en el Middle East Institute. London sirvió en el Servicio Clandestino de la CIA durante más de 34 años, principalmente en el Medio Oriente, Asia Meridional y Central y África, incluidas tres asignaciones como jefe de estación. Síguelo en Twitter en @DouglasLondon5. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario pertenecen al autor. Lee más opinión en CNNEE.(CNN) -- El secretario general de la OTAN, Jens Stoltenberg, está entre los que advierten de una ""nueva fase"" en la guerra de Ucrania que probablemente incluirá combates más intensos. Este mensaje presagia la necesidad de aumentar la cantidad y la calidad de los suministros de guerra a Ucrania.Y lo que es más revelador, los líderes occidentales se están preparando para un conflicto prolongado, dada la escasa posibilidad de que el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, se apresure a salir, a pesar de sus pérdidas en el campo de batalla y de los crecientes desafíos en su país.El hecho de que Putin vaya a redoblar sus esfuerzos a corto plazo con una estrategia de tierra quemada dirigida a la población civil no significa que pueda soportar los crecientes costos a largo plazo. Occidente debe reconocer que Putin no es partidario de mantener el statu quo ni de seguir las reglas de los demás. Pero tampoco es del tipo suicida si se ejerce una presión creciente.'Putin es un asesino', dice un guardameta ucraniano 1:36El futuro depende de calibrar con precisión las intenciones de Putin a través de su mentalidad y visión del mundo, no de la nuestra, una capacidad de la que Occidente —en particular Estados Unidos— ha carecido históricamente.Putin es un antiguo oficial de la KGB que alcanzó la madurez durante la Guerra Fría. Los oficiales de inteligencia, especialmente los que dirigen operaciones en el extranjero, son personas que asumen riesgos, pero no son jugadores. En el espionaje, rara vez hay jugadas desesperadas.Tratar de hacer de este conflicto un choque existencial de civilizaciones no era ni un exceso emocional ni estaba fuera del carácter de Putin, dados sus antecedentes, que incluyen una predisposición a emplear el terrorismo como herramienta.Catherine Belton, autora de ""Putin's People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took on the West"" (El pueblo de Putin: cómo la KGB recuperó Rusia y luego se enfrentó a Occidente), escribió que durante su misión en la KGB en Dresde —entonces Alemania Oriental— Putin trabajó en apoyo de los miembros de la Facción del Ejército Rojo, el grupo terrorista de extrema izquierda responsable de atentados, secuestros y asesinatos en toda Alemania Occidental en los años 70 y 80.¿Hay posibilidades de un golpe de Estado contra Putin? 1:34A Putin no le frena el ordenamiento global posterior a la Segunda Guerra Mundial ni las reglas de deportividad del marqués de Queensberry. Cree que Estados Unidos y sus aliados establecieron esas reglas para promover sus propios valores e intereses a expensas de Rusia. Esa experiencia le llegó al ser testigo del colapso de la Unión Soviética y, con ella, del orden mundial bipolar que había conocido.Por lo tanto, el curso posterior de Putin no debería sorprender al mirar hacia atrás en los últimos 20 años, siempre y cuando no tratemos de entenderlo desde nada más que su propia perspectiva.Es importante que desmitifiquemos sus decisiones comprendiendo que su mentalidad es el producto de una experiencia racista, elitista y xenófoba de la KGB en la época de la Guerra Fría, en la que la fuerza hacía el bien.Pasé toda una vida en las trincheras del espionaje dirigiendo operaciones de inteligencia contra personas como Putin y sus hermanos del KGB, el FSB y el SVR. Mis encuentros ofrecieron diferentes visiones debido a sus variadas circunstancias.Algunos eran intercambios bilaterales bien programados que se asemejaban a un cruce entre una exposición de quejas seinfeldiana y un proselitismo evangelista.Como jefe de estación de la CIA, en ocasiones tuve que enfrentarme a agresivos oficiales de inteligencia rusos que habían puesto sus ojos en un miembro de la comunidad estadounidense. Pero lo más gratificante fueron las reveladoras viñetas que obtuve más allá de la vista del público y desde la clandestinidad.¿Es delito mentir sobre la guerra? Un experto lo aclara 1:27En una de mis primeras experiencias, conseguí que me llevara un oficial de inteligencia ruso que había estado cultivando. Sería un contemporáneo de Putin, mayor y más veterano que yo en ese momento. Era muy educado, simpático y experto en ajustar su comportamiento para adaptarse a la habitación: como he dicho, un espía. El oficial de la KGB se presentaba en público como un hombre pulido, erudito y diplomático.Relajado mientras estaba a solas conmigo en su coche, también estaba algo desmejorado tras una noche de copas. Tal vez debido a ese estado, me ofreció un largo discurso en el que me explicó siglos de privilegios rusos legítimos y humillaciones impuestas por Occidente.El exasperado oficial de la KGB argumentó que las razas blancas de Rusia y Estados Unidos deberían vivir y dejar vivir políticamente y centrarse en cambio en ""las amenazas de quinta columna que compartimos de los mestizos"" y en los desafíos norte-sur de ""los menos civilizados a los que había que poner a raya"".Su narrativa abordó ""los estragos históricos de las hordas mongolas merodeadoras"", código para China, hasta ""los bárbaros turcos a través de los 'stans de Asia Central"". Completamente lúcido, aunque ciertamente ebrio, mezcló sus observaciones con misoginia, insultos étnicos y comentarios sobre la decadencia estadounidense, que van desde los homosexuales hasta la comida rápida e, irónicamente, el abuso de sustancias.¿Puede la comunidad internacional detener a Putin? 2:07Al final, el oficial de la KGB, que se comportó casi como un profesor cuando quizás empezó a recuperar la sobriedad, hizo una erudita defensa del sistema de su país. El modelo autoritario de Moscú, explicó, premiaba la conformidad y la lealtad y beneficiaba a la élite. El proletariado se beneficiaba simplemente a cambio de un servicio leal e incuestionable.El veterano espía describió una estructura que se perfilaba curiosamente a lo largo de las líneas de un sistema de distribución social y económica por goteo. Su sistema, argumentaba, era más eficiente y justo que el del corrupto y caótico Occidente.Putin es la encarnación de toda una vida de este tipo de condicionamiento, cuyas acciones ilustran una firme creencia en los dichos más grotescos y literales de Sun Tzu y Maquiavelo de que el fin justifica los medios. Él cree que Ucrania, al igual que otros antiguos estados soviéticos, son partes históricamente conquistadas de Rusia porque eso es lo que le han condicionado a creer.La población de estos territorios, aunque a sus ojos es étnica y socialmente inferior a los rusos de su propia casta superior, son legítimamente sus ciudadanos y siervos. Deshumanizarlos, así como alegar amenazas desde el interior, permite el uso de purgas, hambre y campos de concentración como los que Josef Stalin utilizó sin vacilar. Y también explica la perspectiva detrás de los comentarios de Putin sobre una ""autopurificación de la sociedad"" y su brutal estrategia en Ucrania.De manera aterradora, la capacidad de Putin de deshumanizar a la gente como ""mosquitos"" traidores que deben adaptarse, ser reeducados o eliminados por la fuerza no es una locura ni algo exclusivo de él.Por nuestra cuenta y riesgo, consideramos este comportamiento como una aberración, la niebla de la guerra o un ejército indisciplinado. Deberíamos reconocer su actitud como el reflejo de una mentalidad arraigada en los agravios históricos a los que él y los de su generación creen que ha sido sometida Rusia. Sabiendo esto, Occidente debería estar decidido a no permitir que el conflicto de Ucrania se prolongue indefinidamente con Putin atrincherado en una guerra de desgaste.Piden enjuiciar a líderes rusos por presuntos crímenes de guerra 3:00Aunque no es conscientemente imprudente, Putin sufre de la arrogancia de los poderosos. Si es como los otros oficiales de inteligencia rusos que he conocido, es probable que Putin se ponga naturalmente a la defensiva cuando se le desafía, creyendo que sus conclusiones son el producto de un estudio intensivo, de la experiencia y de sus propias pruebas exhaustivas.Los puntos de vista alternativos son desprecios irrespetuosos. Tendrá que llegar a la conclusión de que necesita reducir sus pérdidas por sí mismo, pero Putin ya se habrá dado cuenta de que la inteligencia, las estimaciones y la verdad sobre el terreno sobre la que hizo sus cálculos y planes para invadir eran erróneos.Para limitar a Putin es necesario estar alerta y correr riesgos calculados para seguir aumentando la presión destinada a forzar su mano. Cuanto más amenace, más débil será esa mano. Cuando Putin se encuentra en una posición de fuerza, no necesita ir de farol, sino que simplemente actúa para aprovechar su ventaja. Si las negociaciones ofrecen la posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo, éste solo será tan vinculante como las circunstancias imperantes, lo que requiere una campaña a largo plazo para mantener la cantidad adecuada de presión para limitarlo.El peligro cíclico, sin embargo, vendrá del agotamiento público y la complacencia política que podría producirse cuando Ucrania desaparezca de los titulares. Mantener a Putin bajo control es recordar que el pasado es un prólogo.La paz requerirá vigilancia y coherencia para aprovechar las consecuencias tangibles de la agresión. Putin escalará si puede, pondrá a prueba nuestros límites, se atrincherará si se le permite, pero transigirá por necesidad si no puede. Lo que Putin no hará es reformar o abandonar su visión, así que es imperativo que entendamos esa visión a través de sus ojos.";"'Putin es un asesino', dice un guardameta ucraniano 1:36Nota del editor: Douglas London es el autor de ""El reclutador: el espionaje y el arte perdido de la inteligencia estadounidense"".Este mensaje presagia la necesidad de aumentar la cantidad y la calidad de los suministros de guerra a Ucrania.Los oficiales de inteligencia, especialmente los que dirigen operaciones en el extranjero, son personas que asumen riesgos, pero no son jugadores.El modelo autoritario de Moscú, explicó, premiaba la conformidad y la lealtad y beneficiaba a la élite.Lo que Putin no hará es reformar o abandonar su visión, así que es imperativo que entendamos esa visión a través de sus ojos.";['través', 'vladimir', 'el', 'los', 'la', 'que', 'mundo', 'y', 'sus', 'es', 'putin', 'una', 'ojos', 'opinión', 'en', 'viendo'];0.006818181818181814;neutral
CNN;Aeropuerto en EE.UU. recupera título como el más transitado del mundo;"Perra de concurso extraviada en el aeropuerto de Atlanta 1:18(CNN) -- Hazte a un lado, Guangzhou. El Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson de Atlanta en Georgia es de nuevo el aeropuerto más transitado del mundo.El aeropuerto de Atlanta, EE.UU., fue desplazado del puesto número 1 al número 2 en volumen de pasajeros en 2020 por el Aeropuerto Internacional de Guangzhou Baiyun en China, rompiendo la racha de 22 años del aeropuerto de Atlanta en el primer puesto.Pero en las clasificaciones de 2021 publicadas este lunes por la asociación comercial Airports Council International, el aeropuerto de Atlanta volvió a estar en la cima del listado, una señal de recuperación de la caída precipitada del tráfico aéreo de 2020 cuando se apoderó de la pandemia.En 2021, el aeropuerto de Atlanta vio 75,7 millones de pasajeros. Esa cifra es un 76% superior a la de 2020, pero aún casi un 32% por debajo de las cifras previas a la pandemia de 2019.El aeropuerto de Guangzhou cayó al puesto número 8 en 2021, con 40,3 millones de pasajeros. Otro aeropuerto en China, el Aeropuerto Internacional Shuangliu de Chengdu, ocupa el noveno lugar en la lista de 2021  estaba en el No. 3 en 2020.publicidadLos aeropuertos estadounidenses dominaron las clasificaciones de tráfico de pasajeros en 2021, con ocho de las 10 principales aéreas del mundo en Estados Unidos.El Aeropuerto Internacional de Dallas/Fort Worth en Texas fue el segundo más transitado en 2021, con alrededor de 62,5 millones de pasajeros, y el aeropuerto internacional de Denver, Colorado, ocupó el tercer lugar, con 58,8 millones de pasajeros.Los aeropuertos de O'Hare de Chicago y Los Angeles International completaron los cinco primeros.La lista muestra ""una tendencia alentadora de recuperación"", dijo Luis Felipe de Oliveira, director general de ACI World, en un comunicado.""Aunque somos cautelosos de que la recuperación podría enfrentar múltiples obstáculos, el impulso creado por los planes de reapertura de los países podría generar un aumento en los viajes en la segunda mitad de 2022"", dijo de Oliveira.En 2021, se estima que había 4500 millones de pasajeros en todo el mundo, según ACI. Esa cifra representa un aumento de casi el 25 % desde 2020, pero una caída de más del 50% desde 2019.Aeropuertos de EE.UU. y China cambian de lugarDada la recuperación mucho más rápida de los viajes nacionales en comparación con los viajes internacionales, los aeropuertos que estaban muy por debajo de la lista de los los aeropuertos más concurridos antes de la pandemia han saltado al top 10.Los aeropuertos en Charlotte, Carolina del Norte (No. 6)  Orlando, Florida (No. 7)  y Las Vegas (No. 10) son nuevos en el top 10 este año. Los imanes de vacaciones Orlando y Las Vegas ocuparon el puesto 31 y 30 en tráfico de pasajeros antes de la pandemia en 2019.El sólido desempeño de Estados Unidos en el top 10 es un revés al de 2020, cuando los aeropuertos de China ocuparon siete de los top 10 más importantes.El dominio de China en 2020 se debió al repunte inicial de los viajes nacionales en China. El país aún no ha reabierto a los visitantes internacionales.""Si miramos hacia atrás en 2020, China fue uno de los primeros en salir de las olas iniciales de la pandemia y, de hecho, casi alcanzó una recuperación total a fines de 2020"", dijo Patrick Lucas, vicepresidente de economía de ACI World.Pero en 2021, el tráfico nacional en China se redujo significativamente con nuevos confinamientos, mientras que Estados Unidos experimentó un gran salto.Estados Unidos tiene el mercado de viajes domésticos más grande del mundo, seguido por China.Los aeropuertos que habitualmente aterrizaban en el top 10 de la lista de aeropuertos más transitados del mundo, como Dubai International, London Heathrow y Paris Charles de Gaulle, han estado ausentes durante la pandemia.""Aquellos mercados que tenían proporciones muy altas de tráfico internacional, por supuesto, se vieron afectados como resultado de todas estas restricciones y requisitos de cuarentena"", dijo Lucas.El importante papel del tráfico internacional también es parte de la razón por la que los aeropuertos de Beijing Capital y Shanghai Pudong International han salido del top 10. Beijing Capital, que solía ser el número 2 en tráfico de pasajeros, también está viendo su tráfico dividido por el nuevo aeropuerto internacional de Daxing de la ciudad.Revertir las restriccionesACI aboga por un ""enfoque basado en el riesgo"" para aliviar las restricciones de viaje, siguiendo los datos de covid-19, dijo Lucas.""Las vacunas en realidad han sido el pasaporte para viajar, pero como podemos ver ahora, muchos mercados importantes se están abriendo y... muchos países se han dado cuenta de que frenar los viajes o imponer restricciones de viaje en realidad no hace nada"", dijo él.""En todo caso, crea aún más daño. Lo que significa que interrumpe las ganancias socioeconómicas del transporte aéreo y el turismo, etc"".Tal como está, ACI espera que el número total de tráfico de pasajeros se recupere a los niveles previos a la pandemia en 2024.Sin embargo, se espera que los mercados nacionales fuertes, incluido Estados Unidos, se recuperen para 2023. Y los mercados con una alta proporción de tráfico internacional no se espera que se recuperen hasta 2025, dijo Lucas.A nivel mundial, hay ""diferentes fuerzas que se mueven en direcciones opuestas"".Hay una demanda reprimida muy fuerte y el levantamiento de las restricciones que han frenado los viajes frente al aumento del costo de los viajes y las preocupaciones geopolíticas relacionadas con lo que está sucediendo en Europa del Este, agregó Lucas.Pero en general, ACI es optimista. ""Tenemos la sensación de que los consumidores, los pasajeros, morderán la bala, por así decirlo, a pesar del aumento en el costo de los viajes"".";Perra de concurso extraviada en el aeropuerto de Atlanta 1:18(CNN) -- Hazte a un lado, Guangzhou.El Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson de Atlanta en Georgia es de nuevo el aeropuerto más transitado del mundo.El aeropuerto de Atlanta, EE.UU., fue desplazado del puesto número 1 al número 2 en volumen de pasajeros en 2020 por el Aeropuerto Internacional de Guangzhou Baiyun en China, rompiendo la racha de 22 años del aeropuerto de Atlanta en el primer puesto.Otro aeropuerto en China, el Aeropuerto Internacional Shuangliu de Chengdu, ocupa el noveno lugar en la lista de 2021  estaba en el No.El Aeropuerto Internacional de Dallas/Fort Worth en Texas fue el segundo más transitado en 2021, con alrededor de 62,5 millones de pasajeros, y el aeropuerto internacional de Denver, Colorado, ocupó el tercer lugar, con 58,8 millones de pasajeros.;['del', 'más', 'título', 'eeuu', 'aeropuerto', 'el', 'los', 'la', 'que', 'mundo', 'transitado', 'y', 'recupera', 'las', 'como', 'en', 'se'];0.25625;positive
CNN;La frecuencia con la que lavas el plato de tu perro puede afectar tu salud;"Este hotel para mascotas ayuda a los animales callejeros 0:53(CNN) — La forma en que alimentamos a nuestras mascotas, almacenamos su comida y lavamos sus platos puede tener consecuencias negativas para la salud si no se hace correctamente, tanto para los humanos como para los animales.Ha habido múltiples brotes de enfermedades entre humanos después de la exposición a alimentos para perros contaminados con E. coli- y salmonela- lo que ha sido más probable en las dietas comerciales y caseras de alimentos crudos. Estas dietas generalmente implican la necesidad de preparar los alimentos de las mascotas en la cocina, según un estudio publicado el miércoles en la revista PLOS ONE.Sin embargo, las pautas sobre cómo los dueños deben manejar de manera segura los platos y los alimentos para mascotas son limitadas, y su efectividad no está clara, por lo que los autores del nuevo estudio investigaron los hábitos de alimentación de los dueños de perros y analizaron el impacto de los protocolos de higiene de la Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) de Estados Unidos en la contaminación de los platos de comida para perros.Durante conversaciones informales entre nutricionistas veterinarios, ""nos dimos cuenta de que, cuando se trataba de nuestras propias mascotas, todos teníamos diferentes prácticas de higiene y almacenamiento de alimentos para mascotas"", dijo Emily Luisana, coautora del estudio y nutricionista veterinaria de pequeños animales. ""Una vez que nos dimos cuenta de que las recomendaciones (de la FDA) eran relativamente desconocidas incluso entre los profesionales, queríamos ver qué estaban haciendo otros dueños de mascotas"".Luisana forma parte del consejo asesor veterinario de Tailored, una empresa de alimentos para perros dirigida por expertos en nutrición de mascotas. Caitlyn Getty, otra coautora del estudio, es la veterinaria de asuntos científicos de NomNomNow Inc., una empresa centrada en la salud intestinal de las mascotas y la alimentación adecuada. Ninguna de las compañías financió este estudio, y los autores no reportaron ningún interés en competencia. El enfoque del estudio es el manejo de cualquier alimento para perros por parte de los propietarios, no las marcas de alimentos en sí.publicidadConciencia vs. acciónLos investigadores encontraron que el 4,7 % de los 417 dueños de perros encuestados conocían las pautas de manipulación de alimentos para mascotas y de higiene de los platos de la FDA: el 43% de los participantes almacenó comida para perros a menos de 1,5 metros de la comida para humanos, el 34% se lavó las manos después de comer y el 33 % preparó la comida para perros en superficies de preparación destinadas al uso humano.Cincuenta propietarios (de un total de 68 perros) participaron en un experimento de contaminación de tazones de aproximadamente ocho días. Los autores tomaron muestras de los tazones en busca de poblaciones bacterianas, que se conocen como recuentos de placas aeróbicas, y luego dividieron a los propietarios en tres grupos: el grupo A siguió los consejos de la FDA, que incluían lavarse las manos antes y después de manipular alimentos para mascotas y no usar el tazón para servir la comida, lavar el recipiente y los utensilios para recoger con pala con jabón y agua caliente después de usarlos, desechar los alimentos no consumidos de la manera designada y guardar los alimentos secos para mascotas en su bolsa original.El grupo B tuvo que seguir los consejos de manipulación de alimentos de la FDA tanto para mascotas como para humanos, que también requerían lavarse las manos durante al menos 20 segundos con agua tibia y jabón  raspar la comida de los platos antes de lavarlos  lavar los platos con agua y jabón a más de 71 grados centígrados durante al menos 30 segundos, secarlos completamente con una toalla limpia o usar un lavavajillas certificado por la Fundación Nacional de Saneamiento para lavar y secar.Al grupo C no se le dio ninguna instrucción, pero se le dijo cuándo ocurriría el segundo hisopado.Las prácticas seguidas por los grupos A y B condujeron a reducciones significativas en la contaminación de los platos de comida, en comparación con el Grupo C, encontró el estudio. Los platos lavados con agua caliente o lavavajillas tuvieron una disminución de 1,5 unidades en la escala de contaminación en comparación con los lavados con agua fría o tibia. Las ""directrices de limpieza y desinfección de los platos para humanos de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE. UU. se basan en lograr una reducción de 5 log en el recuento de bacterias"", escribieron los autores. Una reducción de 1,5 log equivale a una reducción del 90% al 99 % en microorganismos  una reducción de 5 log significa que el 99,999 % de los microorganismos han muerto.La contaminación de los tazones en el Grupo C aumentó entre hisopados. Ninguno de los propietarios del Grupo C había lavado los tazones de sus perros en los ocho días desde que los autores recolectaron la primera muestra bacteriana, ""a pesar de que sabían que existían las pautas de la FDA y que se volverían a tomar muestras del tazón"", dijo Luisana.""Esto demuestra que dar a conocer las recomendaciones actuales no es suficiente en sí mismo"", agregó.Reducción del riesgo de contaminaciónLos autores dijeron que creen que esta educación es especialmente importante para las poblaciones vulnerables, como las personas inmunodeprimidas.Los platos de comida para mascotas se han clasificado entre los objetos domésticos más contaminados, a veces incluso con cargas bacterianas cercanas a las de los inodoros, según estudios publicados en los últimos 15 años.Sin embargo, el 20% de las personas de los grupos A y B en el estudio actual dijeron que era probable que siguieran las instrucciones de higiene a largo plazo, e incluso menos, el 8%, dijo que era probable que siguieran todas las pautas dadas.""Nuestro estudio muestra que los dueños de mascotas acuden a su veterinario, tienda de alimentos para mascotas y fabricantes de alimentos para mascotas para obtener información sobre el almacenamiento de alimentos para mascotas y las pautas de higiene"", dijo Luisana.

""Los que tienen heridas leves han sido dados de alta para volver a casa, los heridos graves están siendo transportados a regiones seguras y se les está proporcionando la ayuda necesaria"".Las operaciones de limpieza en el lugar de la explosión comenzaron. CNN vio a trabajadores con guantes de plástico recoger restos humanos dispersos. Otros buscaban entre los papeles y documentos que estaban esparcidos por la estación. Bolsas de plástico llenas de comida yacían en el suelo, junto a sombreros, guantes y zapatos destrozados.Se veían varios puntos de impacto del ataque, incluido lo que parecía haber sido un impacto directo en un automóvil. Junto a las vías había charcos de sangre y un perro muerto, parcialmente cubierto por una lona blanca.Estos son otros de los últimos titulares del conflicto entre Rusia y Ucrania:El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania dice que el plan inicial de Rusia para la invasión ""fracasó"": El ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania, Dmytro Kuleba, dijo el domingo en el programa ""Meet the Press"" de la NBC que el plan inicial de Rusia para la invasión de Ucrania ""fracasó"" y que ""la historia demostrará de quién es el plan que prevalecerá"", después de que Rusia nombrara a un nuevo general para dirigir su invasión militar. Cuando se le pidió que comentara el nombramiento del general del ejército ruso Alexander Dvornikov para dirigir la guerra en Ucrania, Kuleba dijo que ""ahora ellos tienen otro plan, pero nosotros tenemos nuestros planes"". Y añadió: ""Sea lo que sea que Rusia esté planeando hacer, nosotros tenemos nuestra estrategia y esta estrategia se basa en la suposición de que, en la confianza de que ganaremos esta guerra y liberaremos nuestros territorios"".Los rusos podrían estar preparando una gran ofensiva en el este de Ucrania: Funcionarios ucranianos dicen que se están produciendo importantes combates en el este del país, con fuertes bombardeos reportados en toda la región de Donbás, frente a lo que están advirtiendo puede ser una gran ofensiva rusa. El jefe de la inteligencia de defensa de Ucrania dijo el viernes a CNN que las tropas rusas se están reagrupando al otro lado de la frontera y planean avanzar hacia Járkiv. Las autoridades han instado a la evacuación de los civiles de la región, ya que las fuerzas rusas se centran en el sur y el este de Ucrania. Las imágenes de satélite recogidas y analizadas por Maxar Technologies muestran un convoy militar de ocho millas de largo moviéndose hacia el sur a través de la ciudad de Velkyi Burluk, en el este de Ucrania, el 8 de abril. La ciudad se encuentra al este de Járkiv, cerca de la frontera de Ucrania con Rusia.El exdirector de la CIA dice que la batalla en el este de Ucrania ""será una gran lucha"" con el grupo de fuerzas rusas: El general retirado David Petraeus, exdirector de la CIA y comandante del Mando Central que también supervisó la guerra en Afganistán hasta 2010, dijo que los ucranianos pueden esperar ""una gran lucha"" ya que las fuerzas rusas se están preparando para un ""avance masivo"" en el este de Ucrania.Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores de Ucrania: ""Extremadamente difícil"" pensar en negociaciones tras los ataques rusos en Kramatorsk y Bucha: Kuleba dijo el domingo que sería ""extremadamente difícil"" incluso pensar en negociaciones con Rusia tras el ataque con misiles en la ciudad oriental de Kramatorsk y las atrocidades cometidas en la localidad de Bucha.

""Entiendo las consecuencias económicas para los países de Europa Occidental si impusieran una especie de embargo de petróleo y gas como el que Estados Unidos ha impuesto contra el petróleo y el gas rusos, pero tienen que hacerlo"". Cheney, republicana de Wyoming, dijo a Jake Tapper, de CNN en el programa ""State of the Union"", que Estados Unidos debería aumentar su propia producción de petróleo para ayudar a Europa, pero añadió: ""Tienen que entender que cada vez, cada día que siguen importando petróleo y gas ruso, están financiando el genocidio de Putin en Ucrania"".El asesor de seguridad nacional de EE.UU. advierte que el nuevo general ruso podría llevar a cabo más ataques contra civiles: El asesor de seguridad nacional Jake Sullivan advirtió que Estados Unidos espera que el nuevo general de alto rango de Rusia que dirige su guerra en Ucrania lleve a cabo más ataques brutales contra civiles. ""Este general en particular tiene un currículum que incluye brutalidad contra civiles en otros escenarios, en Siria, y podemos esperar más de lo mismo en este escenario"", dijo Sullivan a Tapper en ""State of the Union"".

CNN;9 productos para el cuidado de la piel con altas calificaciones en Amazon;Por Hannah WilliamsCon tantas opciones disponibles, puede ser difícil encontrar productos antienvejecimiento para el cuidado de la piel que cumplan con sus promesas de borrar arrugas, manchas de la edad y líneas finas, sin que sean extremadamente caros.Reunimos nueve productos antienvejecimiento altamente calificados para el cuidado de la piel que puedes comprar en Amazon ahora mismo.Pero primero, hablemos de algunos ingredientes clave que se encuentran en muchas de estas opciones, para ayudar a determinar cuáles son los mejores para ti.Ingredientes a conocerVitamina C: Este antioxidante es una potencia en el mundo del antienvejecimiento. Se dice que es altamente efectivo para promover la producción de colágeno, y los usuarios promocionan su capacidad para iluminar su tez, igualar el tono y la textura de la piel y eliminar las manchas oscuras.Retinol: El retinol es un tipo de vitamina A comercializada para productos antienvejecimiento debido a su capacidad para acelerar la renovación celular. Muchos usuarios reportan una piel más suave y de aspecto más joven después del uso regular. Debido a que el retinol hace que arroje células de la piel más rápido, su piel puede sentirse un poco seca y escamosa al principio. De hecho, muchos dermatólogos recomiendan que lo uses solo unas pocas noches a la semana antes de convertirlo en una parte regular de tu rutina de cuidado de la piel.Ácido hialurónico: ¡Ah, el santo grial de la hidratación! El ácido hialurónico es un imán para la humedad, con la capacidad de retener más de 1.000 veces su peso en agua, ¿qué tal eso para vencer la resequedad? La piel hidratada disminuye la aparición de líneas finas y arrugas, y el ácido hialurónico es una excelente manera de contrarrestar los posibles efectos de secado de la vitamina C y los retinoides.Ácido glicólico: Este ácido pertenece a la familia alfa-hidroxi y es mejor conocido por su capacidad para estimular el crecimiento del colágeno. Muchos usuarios informan que el ácido glicólico elimina su acné, ilumina su piel y reduce la aparición de manchas marrones.Por supuesto, la piel de cada persona es diferente, y no existe tal cosa como un elixir milagroso.

Y no, no nos referimos solo a cuando estás en la playa.

Nos encanta especialmente este protector solar facial de EltaMD, que es libre de aceite y ligero e incluso actúa como una gran base para el maquillaje.Limpiador exfoliante de ácido glicólico Body MerryCómpralo por MX$ 269Cada régimen de cuidado de la piel comienza con un limpiador de calidad.

CNN;DeSantis supera los US$ 100 millones para la reelección de Florida;"Cerrar albergues de niños migrantes en Florida es cruel, dicen activistas 3:45(CNN) -- El gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, recaudó más de US$ 100 millones para su esfuerzo de reelección, el primer candidato a gobernador en el Estado del Sol, y quizás en todo el país, en alcanzar el hito de las nueve cifras únicamente a través de donaciones.La asombrosa suma no solo le da a DeSantis una ventaja sin precedentes sobre los demócratas que intentan derrocarlo este noviembre, sino que también envía un mensaje indiscutible al campo potencial de aspirantes republicanos a la presidencia de 2024 de que ya existe un contendiente prometedor con un profundo apoyo de los principales donantes y votantes de base por igual.Es el tipo de habilidad para recaudar fondos que ""lo catapulta al nivel más alto de posibles candidatos republicanos"", dijo Scott Reed, un operativo veterano del Partido Republicano y ex estratega principal de la Cámara de Comercio de EE.UU.""Él ha grandes porciones –US$ 5 millones y US$ 10 millones por recaudación de fondos– y las está consiguiendo y eso es una señal de advertencia"", indicó Reed. ""DeSantis es la comidilla de todos los cocteles republicanos y de todas las reuniones organizacionales. Su apoyo abarca la clase económica y los conservadores del movimiento. Y esa es una combinación fuerte al principio del juego"".Los últimos números de recaudación de fondos para DeSantis no se harán oficiales hasta este lunes, la fecha límite del estado para informar los totales de marzo. Sin embargo, una revisión de CNN de las contribuciones publicadas en el sitio web de su comité político, Friends of Ron DeSantis, mostró una recaudación de US$ 6,1 millones en marzo. Su campaña y comité político, que son entidades separadas que trabajan para su reelección, habían informado previamente que recaudaron US$ 96 millones combinados este ciclo hasta febrero.publicidadSi bien la proliferación de comités políticos y las diferencias en las leyes de financiación de campañas dificultan la comparación de las cifras de recaudación de fondos entre los límites estatales, parece que DeSantis es el primer candidato en cualquier estado en eclipsar US$ 100 millones por completo en donaciones. Según los datos mantenidos por el organismo de control de finanzas de campaña OpenSecrets, los dos candidatos a gobernador anteriores que acumularon US$ 100 millones en campañas (la ex ejecutiva comercial y candidata republicana en 2010 para la gobernadora de California Meg Whitman y el gobernador de Illinois JB Pritzker, cuya familia es propietaria de los hoteles Hyatt) financiaron sus campañas casi en su totalidad con su propio dinero.Sin embargo, DeSantis no es rico de forma independiente. Antes de convertirse en gobernador en 2019, DeSantis sirvió menos de tres mandatos en el Congreso. Antes de eso, fue abogado en la Marina. Su patrimonio neto es de US$ 348.000, según su formulario de divulgación financiera más reciente.En cambio, DeSantis ha batido récords de recaudación de fondos al confiar en una combinación de fuentes. Ha recibido contribuciones significativas de los partidos estatales y nacionales y ha viajado por todo el país para recaudar fondos de donantes republicanos ricos. Su comité político ha recaudado grandes cheques de empresas influyentes de Florida y pequeñas donaciones de los 50 estados.DeSantis también ha aprovechado la red de donantes del expresidente Donald Trump, incluido el cofundador de Home Depot, Bernie Marcus, el director ejecutivo de WeatherTech, David MacNeil, y el magnate naviero Richard Uihlein y su esposa, Elizabeth. Todos han dado sumas de seis cifras al comité político de DeSantis.Debido a que el dinero se recaudó para una carrera estatal, es poco probable que pueda usarse para ayudar a DeSantis en una campaña federal, en caso de que se presente en el futuro. Pero el expresidente George W. Bush demostró cómo un bombardeo incesante de recaudación de fondos en una carrera estatal puede impulsar una posible candidatura presidencial.Al igual que DeSantis, Bush en 1998 era un titular republicano ampliamente visto como un serio contendiente para la próxima carrera presidencial. Bush señaló que sería un candidato formidable para la Casa Blanca al presentar llamativas cifras de recaudación de fondos en el camino hacia un histórico margen de victoria en el estado de Lonestar.""He visto a mucha gente recaudar ese tipo de dinero antes. No siempre significa éxito"", dijo Charlie Black, quien trabajó en la campaña presidencial de Bush. ""Bush tuvo éxito con esa estrategia. Lo más importante que tiene que hacer DeSantis es mantener la vista en el balón y asegurarse de que sea reelegido"".Otros contendientes potenciales para 2024 están notando la destreza de recaudación de fondos de DeSantis, incluido Trump. El expresidente ha monitoreado de cerca qué exdonantes han abierto sus chequeras al gobernador de Florida, dijeron previamente a CNN personas cercanas a Trump.Trump reiteró a The Washington Post esta semana su creencia de que ""hizo"" a DeSantis cuando respaldó al congresista menos conocido y sin fondos suficientes en las primarias republicanas de 2018 para gobernador de Florida. Agregó que no cree que DeSantis, ni ningún otro aliado, se postule en 2024 si el expresidente está en la carrera.“Si me postulo, no puedo imaginar que ellos quieran postularse”, dijo Trump. ""Algunos por lealtad habrían tenido dificultades para postularse"".Un asesor de un posible candidato presidencial reconoció que importantes donantes republicanos probablemente vean en DeSantis ""una oportunidad para entrar en la planta baja"" de una futura campaña presidencial, una que presente al único candidato que se acerca al apoyo de Trump en las encuestas de principios de 2024. Pero el asesor agregó que DeSantis tiene más que demostrar que ser un recaudador de fondos exitoso.“A pesar de toda la atención que está recibiendo, DeSantis no ha sido probado en gran medida”, dijo el asesor. ""Cuando miras el campo potencial para 2024, se destaca como la persona que nunca se ha enfrentado a un desafío monumental y eso sucederá durante el próximo año y medio. Será un momento crucial para él"".La ventaja de DeSantisEs posible que otros aspirantes a 2024 tengan que pasar de puntillas alrededor de Trump y recaudar dinero a través de comités de acción política con vagas declaraciones de misión sobre ayudar a elegir a los republicanos. Pero como candidato que se postula para la reelección en un estado de alto perfil, DeSantis no tiene que poner excusas para tener una audiencia con donantes republicanos de renombre.La lista de donantes de su campaña para gobernador es quién es quién de la clase económica del Partido Republicano: el empresario John Childs, el administrador de fondos de cobertura Paul Tudor Jones, el exfinanciador de capital privado y exgobernador de Illinois Bruce Rauner, el propietario de los Gigantes de San Francisco, Charles Johnson, y el magnate de la carne seca Troy Link, entre otros.Es una mezcla de patrocinadores anteriores de campañas presidenciales, aliados de Trump y algunas personas, como el administrador de fondos de cobertura Ken Griffin y el presidente de Interactive Brokers Group, Thomas Peterffy, que miran más allá de Trump en 2024. Peterffy le dijo a Bloomberg News el año pasado que preferiría ver a DeSantis como el candidato presidencial republicano en 2024 porque es menos impulsivo que Trump. Griffin descartó respaldar a Trump si se postula nuevamente.El gobernador de Florida ataca a Fauci en su campaña de reelección 2:24Rob Stutzman, un consultor republicano con sede en California, dijo que la recaudación de fondos de DeSantis hasta la fecha ""ciertamente confirma la sabiduría convencional de que él es el favorito para la nominación que no es Trump"".""Demostrar ese tipo de red de recaudación de fondos es lo que otros candidatos notarán cuando evalúen si ingresar al campo para competir contra él"", afirmó. ""Puede ser un problema que también sigue generando los celos de Donald Trump"".Nick Larossi, cabildero y principal recaudador de fondos de DeSantis, dijo que el apoyo del gobernador entre los donantes creció durante la pandemia de coronavirus, cuando desafió a los expertos médicos y levantó las restricciones a las empresas y las escuelas antes que la mayoría de los demás estados. Obtuvo más apoyo a medida que se convirtió en un obstáculo frecuente para el presidente Joe Biden, a menudo desafiando las políticas de la Casa Blanca sobre medidas de mitigación del coronavirus, vacunas e inmigración.“Seguro que lo convierte en un competidor nacional formidable”, dijo Larossi sobre la creciente red de recaudación de fondos de DeSantis. ""Pero también creo que hay un mensaje más grande y uno que el gobernador espera que la gente del partido vea y es hacer lo que dices que vas a hacer y no pedir disculpas por ello, lo que generará apoyo"".DeSantis tiene otra ventaja que alimenta su impulso de recaudación de fondos sin precedentes: las leyes de financiamiento de campañas de Florida no limitan las contribuciones a los comités políticos. Tal como están las cosas, los donantes republicanos adinerados de todo el país y las corporaciones prominentes de Florida han entregado cheques de cinco y seis cifras para apoyar directamente el esfuerzo de reelección de DeSantis. Griffin aportó US$ 5 millones en una sola donación. La Asociación de Gobernadores Republicanos ha aportado más de US$ 10 millones.Es una ventaja que también comparte el gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, otro candidato republicano potencial para 2024 que se enfrenta por primera vez a una pelea de reelección este año. Abbott recaudó US $93 millones hasta el 19 de febrero para su carrera contra el demócrata Beto O'Rourke, según OpenSecrets.Pete Quist, el subdirector de investigación de OpenSecrets, ha estudiado los datos de recaudación de fondos de los gobernadores durante años. Dijo que los titulares se benefician cuando no hay límites de contribución ""porque obtienen dinero de los intereses y los cheques llegan antes y son más grandes"".DeSantis se postuló para gobernador en 2018 como el antídoto para un gobierno estatal que describió como invadido por cabilderos y dinero corporativo.La campaña de DeSantis llamó a su oponente primario republicano, el favorito del establecimiento Adam Putnam, un cómplice del ""dinero de interés especial"" y un ""habitante del pantano"". Tomando prestada una línea de Trump, DeSantis prometió ""drenar el pantano en Tallahassee que necesita ser drenado al igual que Washington"".Sin embargo, desde que fue elegido, las ambiciones políticas de DeSantis se han beneficiado de la generosidad de algunas de las entidades más poderosas y políticamente conectadas de Florida. Su comité político ha recaudado casi US$ 3 millones de las mismas compañías y comités políticos afiliados a la industria que donaron más de US$ 150.000 a Putnam, incluidos Disney, compañías de servicios públicos y un PAC administrado por agentes inmobiliarios estatales.La campaña de DeSantis se negó a comentar para este artículo.Los demócratas hacen campaña desde atrásFlorida, con sus comunidades diversas y dispares repartidas en media docena de importantes mercados televisivos, es un estado notoriamente costoso para montar una campaña. Se espera que los candidatos recauden puñados de dinero en efectivo o aporten dinero de sus propios bolsillos para ser competitivos en las contiendas estatales.Pero incluso para los estándares de Florida, DeSantis se ha convertido en un caso atípico. Ya superó el récord de US$ 88 millones recaudados durante el ciclo electoral de 2014 por su predecesor, el ahora senador Rick Scott, un exejecutivo de atención médica que ayudó a financiar su propia campaña. DeSantis está en camino de eclipsar pronto los US$ 113 millones que él y su oponente de 2018, el demócrata Andrew Gillum, juntos recaudaron en su costosa y reñida carrera por la gobernación. Y aún faltan siete meses para el día de las elecciones.Mientras tanto, los demócratas que intentan derrotar a DeSantis todavía buscan su equilibrio. Hasta febrero, el representante de Estados Unidos Charlie Crist, exgobernador como republicano y candidato demócrata a gobernador en 2014, había recaudado US$ 7,1 millones con US$ 4,7 millones aún disponibles. A la comisionada estatal de Agricultura, Nikki Fried, le quedaban alrededor de US$ 3,6 millones de los US$ 6 millones que informó haber recaudado hasta febrero, mientras que una tercera candidata, la senadora estatal Annette Taddeo, había recaudado menos de US$ 1 millón. La elección primaria es el 23 de agosto.El Partido Demócrata de Florida no respondió a las preguntas sobre su plan para competir con la ventaja de recaudación de fondos de DeSantis. Steve Schale, consultor de la campaña demócrata, espera que el dinero fluya a Florida una vez que el partido tenga un candidato, pero DeSantis, dijo, ""todavía va a gastar más, incluso en los escenarios más optimistas de mi lado"". La brecha en los recursos permitirá a DeSantis ""dictar completamente los términos de la conversación"" a lo largo de la campaña, agregó Schale.""Cuando no tienes suficientes fondos, tienes que tomar malas decisiones constantemente"", comentó Schale, quien participó en campañas pasadas para gobernador. ""Estás eligiendo entre cortarte el brazo derecho o el izquierdo y esperar que no te desangres hasta morir"".Quizás lo más desalentador para los demócratas es la cantidad de efectivo que aún tiene DeSantis. Su campaña tenía US$ 88,5 millones disponibles hasta febrero.Un asesor republicano con sede en Tallahassee desde hace mucho tiempo dijo que la broma en la capital es que el equipo de campaña de DeSantis es el ""grupo más pobre de personas ricas del estado"". Al igual que Trump, DeSantis tiene la reputación de analizar cada dólar gastado por su campaña. A pesar de su creciente perfil político, DeSantis no contó con personal de campaña hasta hace relativamente poco tiempo, y sigue siendo una operación bastante limitada.""Eventualmente, esos recursos se desplegarán"", dijo Iarossi. ""Es frugal. Esa es su reputación.

CNN;Esta es tu última oportunidad para pedir un tercer cheque de estímulo;Un crecimiento económico sin estímulos fiscales, así es el reto de EE.UU. en 2022 2:08Washington (CNN) -- Todavía tienes tiempo para pedir un tercer cheque de estímulo por valor de US$ 1.400 por persona.Los contribuyentes que no hayan recibido el pago o a los que se les deba más dinero del que recibieron inicialmente pueden reclamar un crédito fiscal en su declaración de la renta federal de 2021 antes de la fecha límite del 18 de abril.La gran mayoría de los pagos del tercer estímulo se entregaron automáticamente en las cuentas bancarias de los contribuyentes o mediante un cheque por correo la pasada primavera boreal. Los pagos fueron autorizados por el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense en marzo de 2021 y estaban destinados a ayudar a las personas con dificultades financieras a causa de la pandemia de covid-19.Pero los pagos se calcularon el año pasado sobre la base de la declaración de impuestos federal más reciente archivada en ese momento. Si los ingresos de un contribuyente o el tamaño de su familia cambiaron en 2021, el individuo puede tener derecho a más dinero.Otras personas pueden haber perdido el pago del estímulo por completo. Aquellos con ingresos tan bajos que no tienen que declarar impuestos pueden no haber recibido nunca su pago porque el Servicio de Rentas Internas (IRS, por sus siglas en inglés) no tenía su información.publicidad¿A cuánto ascienden los pagos?La tercera ronda de pagos de estímulo tiene un valor de hasta US$ 1.400 por persona. Un matrimonio con dos hijos, por ejemplo, puede recibir un máximo de US$ 5.600.Las familias pueden recibir hasta US$ 1.400 por cada dependiente de cualquier edad. Las rondas anteriores limitaban los pagos a los dependientes menores de 17 años.Por lo general, los ciudadanos estadounidenses de ingresos bajos y medios y los extranjeros residentes en EE.UU. pueden optar a un pago total o parcial de la tercera ronda de estímulo.Las personas que ganan menos de US$ 75.000 de ingresos brutos ajustados, los jefes de familia (como las familias monoparentales) que ganan menos de US$ 112.500 y los matrimonios que ganan menos de US$ 150.000 pueden recibir el importe total de US$ 1.400 por persona.Pero los pagos se reducen gradualmente a medida que aumentan los ingresos del hogar. Las personas que ganan al menos US$ 80.000 al año de ingresos brutos ajustados, los jefes de familia que ganan al menos US$ 120.000 y los matrimonios que ganan al menos US$ 160.000 no tienen derecho a recibir dinero, independientemente del número de dependientes que tengan.Los inmigrantes indocumentados que no tienen número de la Seguridad Social no tienen derecho a los beneficios. Sin embargo, sus cónyuges e hijos sí tienen derecho a recibir los subsidios siempre que tengan número de Seguridad Social.¿Quién puede recibir más dinero?Los contribuyentes que ganaron menos dinero en 2021 que el año anterior pueden ser elegibles para más dinero del que recibieron inicialmente de la tercera ronda de pagos de estímulo.Entre ellos se encuentran los declarantes solteros que tuvieron ingresos superiores a US$ 80.000 en 2020 pero inferiores a esta cantidad en 2021  las parejas casadas que presentaron una declaración conjunta y tuvieron ingresos superiores a US$ 160.000 en 2020 pero inferiores a esta cantidad en 2021  y los declarantes jefes de familia que tuvieron ingresos superiores a US$ 120.000 en 2020 pero inferiores a esta cantidad en 2021, según el IRS.Las personas y las familias que añadieron un hijo en 2021, por nacimiento, adopción o acogida, podrían recibir dinero adicional. Las familias que añadieron otro tipo de dependiente, como un padre de edad avanzada o un nieto, también pueden ser elegibles.Cómo reclamar el pago en la declaración de ingresosAquellos que crean que les corresponde más dinero deben presentar una declaración de impuestos de 2021, incluso si no suelen declarar impuestos, y reclamar lo que se llama el Crédito de Recuperación de Reembolso. Si un contribuyente tiene derecho a más dinero, éste reducirá los impuestos que debe para 2021 o se incluirá en una devolución de impuestos.Para reclamar el Crédito de Recuperación de Reembolso, un contribuyente necesitará información que fue enviada en una carta del IRS en los últimos dos meses. Conocida como Carta 6475, confirma si un contribuyente recibió un tercer pago de estímulo y la cantidad.Alternativamente, puedes obtener esa información al acceder a tu cuenta en línea del IRS.Para la mayoría de los contribuyentes, la fecha límite para presentar la declaración de impuestos federales es el 18 de abril, aunque es un día más tarde para los residentes de Maine y Massachusetts. Los contribuyentes que tengan dificultades para cumplir con el plazo pueden solicitar una prórroga automática de seis meses mediante el formulario 4868.;en 2022 2:08Washington (CNN) -- Todavía tienes tiempo para pedir un tercer cheque de estímulo por valor de US$ 1.400 por persona.Si los ingresos de un contribuyente o el tamaño de su familia cambiaron en 2021, el individuo puede tener derecho a más dinero.Por lo general, los ciudadanos estadounidenses de ingresos bajos y medios y los extranjeros residentes en EE.UU.Las personas y las familias que añadieron un hijo en 2021, por nacimiento, adopción o acogida, podrían recibir dinero adicional.Conocida como Carta 6475, confirma si un contribuyente recibió un tercer pago de estímulo y la cantidad.;['la', 'ingresos', 'pedir', 'cheque', 'oportunidad', 'por', '2021', 'los', 'en', 'tu', 'el', 'que', 'pueden', 'estímulo', 'tercer', 'última', 'para', 'y', 'es', 'esta'];-0.14333333333333334;negative

CNN;El aumento de los precios lleva a los países al límite;"Estos alimentos subirán de precio en Latinoamérica 2:13Londres (CNN Business) -- Cuando la gente salió a las calles en Egipto en 2011, los manifestantes cantaban sobre la libertad y la justicia social, pero también sobre el pan. El costo de los productos básicos de la despensa se disparó debido al precio vertiginoso de bienes como el trigo, lo que avivó la furia con el presidente Hosni Mubarak.Ahora, más de una década después de la Primavera Árabe, los precios mundiales de los alimentos se están disparando nuevamente. Ya habían alcanzado su nivel más alto registrado a principios de este año cuando la pandemia, el mal tiempo y la crisis climática volcaron la agricultura y amenazaron la seguridad alimentaria de millones de personas. Luego vino la guerra de Rusia en Ucrania, que empeoró mucho la situación, al mismo tiempo que provocó un aumento en el costo del otro combustible esencial diario.La combinación podría generar una ola de inestabilidad política, ya que las personas que ya estaban frustradas con los líderes gubernamentales se ven empujadas al límite por el aumento de los costos.""Es extremadamente preocupante"", dijo Rabah Arezki, alto miembro de la Escuela de Gobierno Kennedy de Harvard y execonomista jefe del Banco Africano de Desarrollo.Los disturbios en Sri Lanka, Pakistán y Perú durante la última semana destacan los riesgos. En Sri Lanka, han estallado protestas por la escasez de gas y otros bienes básicos. La inflación de dos dígitos en Pakistán ha erosionado el apoyo al primer ministro Imran Khan, quien se aferra al poder. Al menos seis personas han muerto en las recientes protestas antigubernamentales en Perú provocadas por el aumento de los precios del combustible. Pero no se espera que el conflicto político se limite a estos países.publicidad""No creo que la gente haya sentido el impacto total del aumento de los precios todavía"", dijo Hamish Kinnear, analista de Medio Oriente y África del Norte en Verisk Maplecroft, una consultora de riesgo mundial.Lecciones de la Primavera ÁrabeLas consecuencias alimentarias de la guerra en Ucrania 1:22En el período previo a las protestas antigubernamentales que se conocieron como la Primavera Árabe —que comenzaron en Túnez a fines de 2010 y se extendieron por Medio Oriente y África del Norte en 2011— los precios de los alimentos aumentaron considerablemente. El índice de precios de los alimentos de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación alcanzó 106,7 en 2010 y saltó a 131,9 en 2011, entonces un récord.“Mohamed Bouazizi no se prendió fuego porque no podía bloguear o votar”, escribió un comentarista emiratí en enero de 2011, refiriéndose al vendedor ambulante cuyo acto de protesta ayudó a lanzar la revolución en Túnez y, en última instancia, en el mundo árabe. ""La gente se prende fuego porque no soporta ver a su familia marchitarse lentamente, no de pena, sino de hambre fría"".Las circunstancias en cada país diferían, pero el panorama general era claro. El aumento de los precios del trigo fue una parte importante del problema.La situación ahora es incluso peor que entonces. Los precios mundiales de los alimentos acaban de alcanzar un nuevo récord. El índice de precios de los alimentos de la FAO publicado el viernes llegó a 159,3 en marzo, casi un 13% más que en febrero. Se espera que la guerra en Ucrania, un importante exportador de trigo, maíz y aceites vegetales, así como las duras sanciones a Rusia, un productor clave de trigo y fertilizantes, provoquen nuevos aumentos de precios en los próximos meses.""Cuarenta por ciento de las exportaciones de trigo y maíz de Ucrania van a Oriente Medio y África, que ya están lidiando con problemas de hambre, y donde una mayor escasez de alimentos o aumentos de precios podrían avivar el malestar social"", dijo Gilbert Houngbo, director del Fondo Internacional para la Agricultura. Desarrollo, dijo el mes pasado.Al dolor se suma el aumento de los precios de la energía. Los precios mundiales del petróleo son casi un 60% más altos que hace un año. El costo del carbón y el gas natural también se ha disparado.Muchos gobiernos luchan por proteger a sus ciudadanos, pero las economías frágiles que se endeudaron mucho para superar la crisis financiera de 2008 y la pandemia son las más vulnerables. A medida que el crecimiento se desacelera, dañando sus monedas y haciendo más difícil mantenerse al día con los pagos de la deuda, será difícil mantener los subsidios para alimentos y combustibles, especialmente si los precios siguen subiendo.""Ahora estamos en una situación en la que los países están endeudados"", dijo Arezki. ""Como resultado, no tienen reservas para tratar de contener las tensiones que surgirán de los precios tan altos"".Según el Banco Mundial, cerca del 60% de los países más pobres ""ya estaban en situación de sobreendeudamiento o en alto riesgo de contraerla"" en vísperas de la invasión de Ucrania.Donde las tensiones están hirviendoPeligra cadena alimentaria por la guerra de Rusia en Ucrania 3:10Asia: en Sri Lanka, una nación insular de 22 millones de habitantes, ya está hirviendo una crisis económica y política, con manifestantes tomando las calles desafiando los toques de queda y la renuncia masiva de ministros del gobierno.Lidiando con altos niveles de deuda y una economía débil que depende del turismo, Sri Lanka se vio obligada a agotar sus reservas de divisas. Eso impidió que el gobierno hiciera pagos por importaciones clave como la energía, lo que generó una escasez devastadora y obligó a las personas a pasar horas haciendo fila para comprar combustible.Sus líderes también han devaluado su moneda, la rupia de Sri Lanka, mientras intentan obtener un rescate del Fondo Monetario Internacional. Pero eso solo empeoró la inflación en casa. En enero llegó al 14%, casi el doble del ritmo de aumento de precios en Estados Unidos.Mientras tanto, Khan de Pakistán se enfrenta a una moción de censura el sábado en el parlamento del país. Si bien sus problemas políticos se remontan a años atrás, ahora lucha contra las denuncias de mala gestión económica a medida que aumenta el costo de los alimentos y el combustible y el gobierno agota sus reservas de divisas.""La magnitud del caos económico ha unido a la oposición a Imran Khan"", dijo Kinnear de Verisk Maplecroft.Medio Oriente y África: los expertos también están atentos a signos de angustia política en otros países de Medio Oriente que dependen en gran medida de las importaciones de alimentos de la región del Mar Negro y, a menudo, brindan generosos subsidios al público.En Líbano, donde casi las tres cuartas partes de la población vivían en la pobreza el año pasado como resultado del colapso político y económico, entre el 70% y el 80% del trigo importado proviene de Rusia y Ucrania. Los silos de granos clave también fueron destruidos durante la explosión de 2020 en el puerto de Beirut.Y Egipto, el mayor comprador de trigo del mundo, ya está experimentando una enorme presión sobre su enorme programa de subsidios para el pan. El país recientemente fijó un precio fijo para el pan no subsidiado luego de que los precios se dispararon, y en su lugar está tratando de asegurar las importaciones de trigo de países como India y Argentina.Con aproximadamente el 70% de los pobres del mundo viviendo en África, el continente también estará ""muy expuesto"" al aumento de los precios de los alimentos y la energía, dijo Arezki.Las sequías y los conflictos en países como Etiopía, Somalia, Sudán del Sur y Burkina Faso han creado una crisis de seguridad alimentaria para más de una cuarta parte de la población del continente, dijo esta semana el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja. La situación corre el riesgo de empeorar en los próximos meses, continuó.La inestabilidad política ya se ha estado acumulando en partes del continente. Se han producido una serie de golpes en África occidental y central desde principios de 2021.Europa: incluso los países con economías más desarrolladas, que tienen mayores protecciones para proteger a los ciudadanos de los dolorosos aumentos de precios, no tendrán las herramientas para amortiguar completamente el golpe.Miles de manifestantes se reunieron en ciudades de Grecia esta semana para exigir salarios más altos para contrarrestar la inflación, mientras que la competencia en elecciones presidenciales de Francia se vuelve más reñida a medida que la candidata de extrema derecha Marine Le Pen destaca sus planes para reducir el costo de vida. El gobierno del presidente Emmanuel Macron dijo el mes pasado que estaba considerando emitir cupones de alimentos para que las familias de ingresos medios y bajos pudieran comer.Jessie Yeung, Rhea Mogul y Sophia Saifi contribuyeron con este reportaje.";"Ahora, más de una década después de la Primavera Árabe, los precios mundiales de los alimentos se están disparando nuevamente.Al menos seis personas han muerto en las recientes protestas antigubernamentales en Perú provocadas por el aumento de los precios del combustible.El aumento de los precios del trigo fue una parte importante del problema.""Ahora estamos en una situación en la que los países están endeudados"", dijo Arezki.Con aproximadamente el 70% de los pobres del mundo viviendo en África, el continente también estará ""muy expuesto"" al aumento de los precios de los alimentos y la energía, dijo Arezki.";['del', 'aumento', 'el', 'los', 'la', 'que', 'lleva', 'las', 'y', 'países', 'precios', 'se', 'en', 'al', 'límite'];0.036111111111111115;neutral
CNN;Ventilación: medida de mitigación contra el covid-19 que recibe atención;"¿Qué cubrebocas te protegen mejor en lugares cerrados? 0:55(CNN) — Más de dos años después del inicio de la pandemia de covid-19, probablemente conozcas los conceptos básicos de protección: vacunas, refuerzos, lavado de manos adecuado y mascarillas. Pero una de las herramientas más poderosas contra el coronavirus es una que los expertos creen que recién comienza a recibir la atención que merece: la ventilación.Contralavado respiratorio""El desafío para las organizaciones que mejoran la calidad del aire es que es invisible"", dijo Joseph Allen, director del Programa de Edificios Saludables en Harvard T.H. Escuela Chan de Salud Pública.Es cierto: otras herramientas contra el covid-19 son más tangibles. Pero visualizar cómo podría comportarse el virus en espacios mal ventilados puede ayudar a las personas a comprender mejor esta medida de mitigación.Allen lo compara con el humo del cigarrillo. ""Si estoy fumando en la esquina de un salón de clases y tiene poca ventilación/filtración, ese salón se llenará de humo y todos respirarán el mismo aire"".Luego aplícalo al aire libre.publicidad""Podría estar fumando un cigarrillo, podrías estar a un par de metros de mí, dependiendo de en qué dirección sople el viento, es posible que ni siquiera sepas que estoy fumando"".Si estás en el interior, podrías estar respirando menos aire fresco de lo que piensas.""Todo el mundo en una habitación respira constantemente aire que acaba de salir de los pulmones de otras personas en esa habitación. Y dependiendo de la tasa de ventilación, podría ser tanto como el 3% o el 4% del aire que estás respirando solo salió de los pulmones de otras personas en esa habitación"", afirmó Allen.Él describe esto como un contralavado respiratorio.""Normalmente, eso no es un problema, ¿verdad? Hacemos esto todo el tiempo. Siempre estamos intercambiando nuestros microbiomas respiratorios entre nosotros. Pero si alguien está enfermo e infeccioso... esos aerosoles pueden transportar el virus. Eso es un problema"".Está en el aire""Hemos sabido durante décadas cómo mantener a las personas a salvo de infecciones en los edificios, de enfermedades infecciosas transmitidas por el aire como esta"", dijo Allen.Desde el comienzo de la pandemia, Allen y otros expertos han agitado banderas rojas, diciendo que la forma en que estábamos pensando sobre la transmisión de covid-19 (superficies, grandes gotas respiratorias) no estaba en lo cierto.""El lavado de manos y el distanciamiento social son apropiados pero, en nuestra opinión, insuficientes para brindar protección contra las microgotas respiratorias portadoras de virus liberadas al aire por personas infectadas. Este problema es especialmente agudo en ambientes interiores o cerrados, particularmente aquellos que están llenos de gente y tienen ventilación inadecuada"", declararon cientos de científicos en una carta abierta en julio de 2020.Finalmente, la Organización Mundial de la Salud y los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE. UU. reconocieron lo que los expertos habían estado diciendo todo el tiempo: que el covid-19 también podría propagarse a través de pequeñas partículas en aerosol que pueden viajar más de 1 metro.El coronavirus en sí es muy pequeño — alrededor de 0,1 micras — pero eso no afecta la distancia que puede viajar.“El tamaño del virus en sí mismo no importa porque, como decimos, el virus nunca está desnudo en el aire. En otras palabras, el virus siempre viaja en partículas respiratorias que se desarrollan en nuestros pulmones. Y esos son todos de diferentes tamaños"", dijo Allen.Cantar o toser puede emitir partículas de hasta 100 micrones (casi el ancho de un cabello humano), dijo, pero el virus tiende a viajar en partículas más pequeñas, entre 1 y 5 micrones.El tamaño de estas partículas afecta no solo la distancia que pueden viajar, sino también la profundidad con la que podemos respirarlas en nuestros pulmones y cómo debemos abordar la protección de este virus.""Cuando hablas de una enfermedad transmitida por el aire, está lo que te rodea, ya sabes, el tipo de personas que conoces que pueden toser en tu cara, la cuestion de los 2 metros, y luego está el aire interior más amplio, porque el aire al interior recircula"", dijo Max Sherman, líder del Grupo de Trabajo sobre Epidemias de la Sociedad Estadounidense de Ingenieros de Calefacción, Refrigeración y Aire Acondicionado.Diluir y limpiar""Afuera es más seguro que adentro"" se ha convertido en un mantra aceptado con el covid-19. Allen señala que protegernos en el interior es donde nuestro enfoque siempre debe estar, incluso más allá de la pandemia.""Somos [una] especie de espacios cerrados. Pasamos el 90% de nuestro tiempo en el interior. El aire que respiramos en el interior tiene un impacto enorme en nuestra salud, ya sea que piense en enfermedades infecciosas o cualquier otra cosa, pero simplemente ha escapado a la conciencia pública durante mucho tiempo"", señaló.Asegurarse de que nuestro aire interior sea saludable no es tan complicado, dijo Sherman. ""Solo deseas reducir la cantidad de partículas que podrían transportar covid o cualquier otro [virus] desagradable"".La forma de hacerlo es a través de la ventilación y la filtración.La filtración, tal como suena, es filtrar o limpiar el aire, eliminando las partículas infectadas. Pero piensa en la ventilación como si diluyera el aire. Estás trayendo más aire fresco para reducir la concentración de esas partículas.La dilución es exactamente la razón por la que no hemos visto eventos de superpropagadores al aire libre, dice Allen.""Casi no tenemos transmisión al aire libre. ¿Por qué es eso? Dilución ilimitada, porque tiene ventilación ilimitada. Y así, incluso en protestas multitudinarias o eventos deportivos al aire libre como el Super Bowl, simplemente no vemos que suceda superpropagación. Pero si lo hiciéramos , haríamos que la señal fuera fuerte y clara. Simplemente no la vemos. Está todo en interiores en estos espacios insalubres y de bajo rendimiento"".Espacios saludablesIncluso antes de la llegada de los sistemas HVAC, la ventilación se integró en muchos diseños de edificios.La Ley de viviendas de vecindad de 1901 de Nueva York requería que cada edificio de vecindad, un edificio con viviendas multifamiliares, tuviera ventilación, agua corriente y luz de gas.Los constructores agregaron ventilación a muchos de estos edificios con un conducto en el medio que va desde el techo hasta el suelo, lo que permite un mayor flujo de aire.""A fines del siglo XIX, la gente finalmente comenzó a comprender cómo se propagan las enfermedades. Por lo tanto, los pozos de aire y la ventilación que los acompaña se vieron como una solución a las crisis de salud pública que estaban ocurriendo en los edificios de viviendas"", dijo Katheryn Lloyd, directora de programación del Museo de la Vivienda. ""Hubo casos altos de tuberculosis, difteria y otras enfermedades que se propagaron. Ahora sabemos que se propagaron por el aire"".Hoy, nos enfrentamos al mismo desafío.""Obtener ventilación básica en su hogar es importante, punto final"", dijo Sherman.Una de las formas más fáciles y económicas de hacerlo es abrir las ventanas.Abre puertas o ventanas en los extremos opuestos de tu casa para crear ventilación cruzada, aconseja la Agencia de Protección Ambiental. Abrir las ventanas más altas y más bajas, especialmente si están en diferentes pisos, de una casa también puede aumentar la ventilación. Agregar un ventilador interior puede llevarlo aún más lejos.""Si se usa un solo ventilador, debe mirar (y soplar aire) en la misma dirección en la que el aire se mueve naturalmente. Puede determinar la dirección en la que el aire se mueve naturalmente observando el movimiento de las cortinas o sosteniendo una tela liviana o tirando recortes de papel y notando en qué dirección se mueven"", dice la EPA.El simple hecho de abrir una ventana puede ayudar mucho, dice Allen: ""Incluso mantener una ventana abierta un par de pulgadas para facilitar realmente los cambios de aire más altos, especialmente si lo hace en varios lugares de la casa, para que pueda crear algunos diferenciales de presión"".Es importante tener en cuenta que si tiene un sistema HVAC, debe estar funcionando para que realmente circule o filtre el aire. La EPA dice que estos sistemas funcionan menos del 25% del tiempo durante las temporadas de calefacción y refrigeración.""La mayoría de los controles en estos días tienen una configuración en la que puede hacer funcionar el ventilador a velocidad baja todo el tiempo. Y eso suele ser lo mejor que se puede hacer porque eso asegura que esté empujando aire a través del filtro todo el tiempo y mezclar el aire en su casa"", aconsejó Sherman.Esto podría ser algo a tener en cuenta si vas a recibir visitas o si alguien en el hogar tiene un mayor riesgo de enfermarse gravemente.Elige el filtro más eficiente que su sistema HVAC pueda manejar y asegúrese de cambiar los filtros de forma rutinaria.Los filtros tienen un valor de informe de eficiencia mínima, o MERV, que indica qué tan bien capturan las partículas pequeñas. La Sociedad Estadounidense de Ingenieros de Calefacción, Refrigeración y Aire Acondicionado recomienda usar al menos un filtro MERV-13, que dice que es al menos un 85% eficiente en la captura de partículas de 1 a 3 micrones.Si esa no es una opción, los filtros de aire portátiles también pueden funcionar bien, pero la EPA dice que use uno que esté hecho para el tamaño de la habitación previsto y cumpla con al menos uno de estos criterios:Diseñado como aire de partículas de alta eficiencia (HEPA)Clasificación CADREl fabricante dice que el dispositivo eliminará la mayoría de las partículas por debajo de 1 micrónEncontrar un espacio seguroCuando ingresa a un espacio, no existe una buena regla general para mirar a su alrededor y evaluar qué tan bien ventilado podría estar, y eso puede ser un desafío cuando las personas tienen la tarea de evaluar su propio riesgo.Allen sugiere comenzar con lo básico: asegúrese de estar al día con las vacunas y saber dónde se encuentran los números de covid-19 en su comunidad.Pero luego se vuelve más difícil. Incluso la cantidad de personas en un espacio no es un indicador de una situación de mayor riesgo.""Cuantas más personas haya dentro, mayor será el riesgo porque es más probable que haya alguien infeccioso, pero si la ventilación es buena, realmente no importa"".Los estándares de ventilación se basan en ""una cantidad de aire fresco por persona, más la cantidad de aire fresco por pie cuadrado"", explicó Allen. ""Entonces, si tiene un buen sistema, cuántas más personas ingresen a la habitación, más ventilación entrará a la habitación"".Una herramienta que puede ayudarlo a evaluar la ventilación en una habitación es un monitor de CO2, algo que Allen desearía ver más en los espacios públicos. Le gusta llevar uno portátil, que se puede pedir en línea por entre US$ 100 y US$ 200.""Si ves menos de 1.000 partes por millón, en general, está alcanzando los objetivos de ventilación que son el estándar de diseño. Pero recuerde, estos no son estándares basados ​​en la salud. Por lo tanto, queremos ver tasas de ventilación más altas"".Allen prefiere ver CO2 a 800 partes por millón o menos. También señala que solo porque un espacio tiene niveles bajos de CO2, podría no ser inseguro si la filtración es alta, como en un avión.Un cambio de juego para las escuelasLa superintendente de las Escuelas Públicas de Atlanta, Lisa Herring, dice que la instalación de 5.000 unidades de filtración de aire, suficientes para cada salón de clases, en su distrito escolar es ""un cambio de juego"".El distrito había comenzado a actualizar los sistemas HVAC en varias escuelas incluso antes de la pandemia, pero los fondos federales le permitieron agregar unidades de filtración durante un momento crucial en el que las mascarillas se han vuelto opcionales.""Nos da un mayor nivel de confianza como sistema saber que nuestros sistemas de filtración de aire están en su lugar"", dijo Herring.Los distritos escolares de todo el país han aprovechado la oportunidad de mejorar la ventilación gracias a la afluencia de fondos federales.Un análisis realizado en febrero por FutureEd, un grupo de expertos de la Escuela de Políticas Públicas McCourt de la Universidad de Georgetown, encontró que las escuelas públicas habían destinado US$ 4.400 millones para proyectos HVAC, que podrían aumentar a casi US$ 10.000 millones si las tendencias continúan.El distrito escolar de Manchester de New Hampshire está invirtiendo casi US$ 35 millones en la actualización de los sistemas HVAC, y la superintendente interina Jennifer Gillis dice que la financiación federal es ""absolutamente clave"".""Uno piensa en un distrito de nuestro tamaño con todas las demandas en competencia y la necesidad de ser fiscalmente responsable, un proyecto de US$ 35 millones, ese es un gran proyecto para introducir en nuestro presupuesto. Tener esos fondos disponibles nos permite hacer 19 proyectos -- y 19 proyectos en muy poco tiempo"".Para Gillis, la ventilación ha sido una importante estrategia de mitigación y una forma discreta de mantener seguras a las personas.""Es algo en lo que la mayoría en el edificio no piensa, pero es una forma muy pasiva de crear seguridad dentro de las escuelas. Desde el principio, el objetivo siempre fue 'involucremos a nuestros niños, incorporemos a nuestro personal, pero hagámoslo de una manera que sea segura para todos ellos'"".Una buena ventilación no se trata solo de mantener a los estudiantes a salvo del covid-19, dice Sherman. También puede mejorar su desempeño en la escuela.""Van a aprender mejor, van a estar más despiertos, van a ser más receptivos. Van a ser más saludables si tienen una buena calidad del aire interior"", dijo.Finalmente al frente y al centroPara ayudar a solidificar el papel de la ventilación en la batalla del covid-19, la administración Biden anunció el mes pasado un Desafío de Aire Limpio en Edificios.El desafío pide a los operadores y propietarios de edificios que mejoren la ventilación siguiendo las pautas establecidas por la EPA.Modelo muestra la propagación del covid-19 en el aire 2:16Las principales acciones incluyen la creación de un plan de acción de aire interior limpio, la optimización de la ventilación de aire fresco, la mejora de la filtración y limpieza del aire, y la participación de la comunidad del edificio comunicándose con los ocupantes para aumentar la conciencia, el compromiso y la participación.El mensaje puede parecer atrasado, pero Allen lo recibió con entusiasmo.“La Casa Blanca usó su púlpito para decir inequívocamente que el aire limpio y los edificios son importantes. Eso es enorme. Independientemente de lo que piense sobre lo que sucederá después con la implementación o lo que sucederá con la financiación. Ese es un mensaje claro que ya se transmite, escuchado por empresas, organizaciones sin fines de lucro, universidades y líderes estatales. Veo que estos cambios ya están ocurriendo"".";"Pero una de las herramientas más poderosas contra el coronavirus es una que los expertos creen que recién comienza a recibir la atención que merece: la ventilación.Finalmente, la Organización Mundial de la Salud y los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.reconocieron lo que los expertos habían estado diciendo todo el tiempo: que el covid-19 también podría propagarse a través de pequeñas partículas en aerosol que pueden viajar más de 1 metro.“El tamaño del virus en sí mismo no importa porque, como decimos, el virus nunca está desnudo en el aire.""Si se usa un solo ventilador, debe mirar (y soplar aire) en la misma dirección en la que el aire se mueve naturalmente.";['contra', 'medida', 'más', 'recibe', 'el', 'que', 'la', 'los', 'las', 'y', 'aire', 'es', 'mitigación', 'atención', 'ventilación', 'en', 'covid19'];0.06700336700336701;neutral
CNN;Es el momento de Pamela Anderson y ahora recupera su poder;"Pamela Anderson como Roxie Hart en ""Chicago"".(CNN) -- En una fresca mañana primaveral en Manhattan, Pamela Anderson ensaya sus líneas para debutar en Broadway. Los guiones están ordenados en la mesa de café frente a ella  pluma en mano, toma notas de último momento. Las bulliciosas calles hacen su murmullo fuera de las ventanas de la suite de su hotel con vista al icónico Central Park de Nueva York, pero ella está muy ocupada para notarlo: tiene trabajo que hacer.En solo días, subirá al escenario para el que dice es el papel más importante de su carrera: Roxie Hart en el musical ""Chicago"" de Bob Fosse.“Simplemente me lancé a los ensayos”, le dijo a CNN. ""Y eran seis, siete, quizás ocho horas al día. Estaba haciendo cuatro horas de baile, una hora de voz, dos horas de actuación... Luego vine a Nueva York y me metí de lleno en esto con David Bushman y el director. Estoy como, '¡Estoy haciéndolo, estoy haciéndolo!'”""Y es increíble porque no me daba cuenta, obviamente, tu voz, es un músculo, y cada día mi voz se vuelve más y más fuerte, hasta que miro detrás de mí y pienso, ¿quién está cantando así?”Anderson cuenta que hace 11 años se le acercó por primera vez para el papel, pero el momento no era el correcto. Dice que no quería dejar a sus dos hijos, a quienes criaba sin la ayuda de una niñera.publicidad""Ni siquiera podía imaginar que eso era algo que yo podía hacer"", afirmó. ""Especialmente con niños pequeños. Mis hijos eran adolescentes en ese momento"".Pero dice que los astros se alinearon cuando recibió la llamada del aclamado productor de Broadway Barry Weissler, hace apenas unos meses. El próximo martes subirá al escenario por primera vez en el Teatro Ambassador en el icónico papel.Anderson, quien nació y creció en la pequeña ciudad canadiense de Ladysmith, comenzó en Hollywood como modelo y se convirtió en una de las estrellas de Playboy más reconocidas, con su primera portada en la revista en 1989.Debutó como actriz en ""Home Improvement"" de ABC, pero luego obtuvo el papel que la convirtió en un nombre familiar: CJ Parker en ""Baywatch"", que protagonizó durante cinco temporadas hasta 1997. A lo largo de su carrera, tuvo innumerables papeles de televisión y en 1996 un papel protagónico en el cine en ""Barb Wire"".Pero tratándose de las tablas, esta es su primera vez.""Voy a estar tan nerviosa"", sonríe. ""Pero también me encanta estar en vivo. He estado hablando un poco en público en Oxford y Cambridge sobre el veganismo y cosas así... así que creo que realmente me va a encantar"".El nombre de Anderson ha estado en el centro de atención en los últimos meses, con la reciente serie sobre una infame grabación de video, y con todos esperando que rompa su silencio. Pero ella aún no lo aborda públicamente.En cambio, dice, está decidida de volver a ser el centro de atención con su oficio.""Estaba en mi pequeño rancho en Canadá con mis perros, mi jardín y todo. Ha pasado un tiempo desde que hice algo, pero nunca había hecho nada de este nivel"".Anderson se pone de pie y camina hacia dos armarios llenos de ropa de diseñador. Comienza a mostrar vestidos, chaquetas y blusas con aire familiar. Y es porque lo tienen. Anderson hizo traer sus looks más icónicos de los años 90 para usarlos en Nueva York.""Nunca compro"", dice, sosteniendo una chaqueta Chanel. ""Todo esto es de cosas que he tenido desde siempre. Solo estoy comprando desde mi armario"", se ríe.Anderson dice que la preparación para ""Chicago"" lo ha abarcado todo  incluso se despierta en la noche, recitando su monólogo.""Estoy soñando y me despierto hablando. Y luego digo, está bien, fue interesante. Me vuelvo a dormir y es como si estuviera bailando en mi mente"", comentó.""No soy bailarina. Así que tuve que juntar todo esto. Ni siquiera sé cómo lo hice. El espectáculo es muy físico. Estoy haciendo la coreografía original, que creo que no siempre se hace. Así que me están dando todo, y obtienes una cosa y te dan otra más. Yo digo: '¡No! Acabo de aprender esto. ¿Ahora hay todo un baile de salida?' Mi cabeza va a explotar. Pero lo hago. Y luego lo entiendo. Estoy como, 'Está bien, lo tengo'"".Tras unos 30 minutos respondiendo a las preguntas, Anderson se aquieta, y se queda mirando la enorme pila de papeles que descansa al otro lado de su amplia suite de hotel.Son sus memorias tan esperadas. También está haciendo un documental con Netflix.""Cuando más joven, recuperé el control en ciertas situaciones, y lo siento de la misma manera [ahora]"", dijo. ""Se siente como un paso más hacia recuperar mi poder y de verdad recobrarlo. Es muy fortalecedor. Y siento que me están apoyando. Sentir apoyo, es un algo nuevo para mí.

CNN;Elon Musk podría hacerle la vida difícil al nuevo CEO de Twitter (Análisis);"Musk, entusiasmado por primera reunión en junta de Twitter 0:37Nueva York (CNN Business) -- En los últimos dos años, Twitter ha tratado con un inversionista activista, una figura egocéntrica con decenas de millones de seguidores que superan los límites de su plataforma y un excéntrico líder multimillonario que intenta mejorar el producto mientras hace malabares con múltiples compañías.Ahora, Twitter parece tener los tres a la vez, en una sola persona: Elon Musk. El CEO de Tesla y SpaceX provocó una avalancha de titulares esta semana después de revelar que se convertiría en el mayor accionista de Twitter. Un día después, la compañía dijo que lo agregaría a su junta directiva por un período de dos años.Estos sorprendentes desarrollos ponen a Twitter, una empresa que ciertamente no es ajena al caos corporativo, en aguas desconocidas.De repente, el hombre más rico del mundo, conocido tanto por su espíritu ambicioso e innovador como por su comportamiento errático y trol, tiene un poderoso asiento en la mesa. Y se incorpora justo cuando el nuevo director ejecutivo de Twitter, Parag Agrawal, anteriormente poco conocido (al menos externamente), intenta salir de la sombra de Jack Dorsey, el fundador de la plataforma y rostro público desde hace mucho tiempo. Dorsey, quien entregó el cargo de CEO en noviembre y planea dejar el directorio de Twitter en mayo, dijo esta semana que Agrawal y Musk ""serán un equipo increíble"".Casi de inmediato, la empresa fue objeto de una tremenda especulación externa. Esto varió desde si Musk, quien previamente sugirió que Twitter no permite suficiente libertad de expresión y preguntó si era necesaria una nueva plataforma rival, cambiaría las políticas de moderación de contenido de la red social, hasta si ayudaría a restaurar la cuenta del expresidente Donald Trump. Dentro de la empresa, la reacción pareció ser mixta  algunos empleados en Twitter parecieron cuestionar qué significaría su presencia para el trabajo de salud y seguridad de Twitter y expresaron su preocupación por los comentarios insultantes que Musk había hecho anteriormente en la plataforma, incluso sobre la comunidad trans.publicidadEl viernes, Twitter confirmó a CNN Business que Agrawal pronto organizaría un evento de ""pregúntame cualquier cosa"" con Musk para los empleados. Es un movimiento inusual, ya que los miembros de la junta corporativa generalmente no interactúan con los empleados de manera tan directa. (La reunión fue reportada por primera vez por el Washington Post.)No está claro exactamente qué espera lograr Musk en Twitter. A diferencia de algunos que han formado parte del directorio de la compañía a lo largo de los años, Musk tiene muchos seguidores en Twitter y un profundo conocimiento de la plataforma. Los inversores ya han aplaudido la medida, con las acciones de Twitter subiendo casi un 19% desde que se reveló su participación en la empresa. Pero los expertos en gobierno corporativo y los observadores de la industria tecnológica dicen que su enfoque poco ortodoxo para unirse a la empresa podría crear complicaciones para la empresa y su nuevo director ejecutivo.""Casi parece que el CEO fue degradado del manejo de asuntos estratégicos y ahora necesita consultar no al presidente de la junta, sino a un director en funciones habitual para obtener asesoramiento sobre la estrategia de la empresa"", dijo Jason Schloetzer, profesor asociado de la Escuela de Negocios McDonough de la Universidad de Georgetown.Twitter se negó a comentar para esta historia.Un miembro del ""equipo"" para un nuevo CEOCuando Dorsey tomó la sorpresiva decisión de dejar el cargo de director ejecutivo a fines de noviembre, dejó a Agrawal, un veterano de la empresa con una década de antigüedad, al mando en un momento crucial para Twitter.La empresa buscaba mejorar su negocio de publicidad digital en medio de cambios de privacidad más amplios en el mercado. Buscaba alcanzar un objetivo elevado para el crecimiento de usuarios bajo la presión de un accionista activista, después de períodos de estancamiento o incluso de disminución del número de usuarios. Al igual que otras empresas de tecnología, también enfrentaba el escrutinio de los legisladores y el público sobre sus prácticas de moderación de contenido.Twitter, aunque es una fracción del tamaño de plataformas rivales como Facebook e Instagram, ha tenido durante mucho tiempo una importancia desmesurada dada su influencia en los medios, la política y las finanzas, entre otras áreas. El propio Agrawal pareció aludir a ese impacto cuando fue nombrado CEO. En un memorando a los empleados en ese momento, escribió: ""El mundo nos está mirando en este momento"".Musk también puede haber estado mirando.""Tiene sentido, el fundador se retira y el CEO es bastante nuevo, ese es un buen momento para que alguien intervenga y trate de efectuar algún cambio"", dijo Schloetzer. Pero, dijo, ""la forma en que eso está evolucionando es diferente a la forma en que evolucionaría normalmente si hubiera un activista [inversionista] que se involucrara"".Incluso si todo va bien y Agrawal y Musk generalmente están alineados en cuanto a prioridades, la participación de este último y las declaraciones públicas podrían complicar el papel de Agrawal como CEO. A la vista del público, y tal vez incluso internamente, Musk podría tener la percepción de ser una especie de CEO en la sombra. También podría obtener crédito por iniciativas que ya estaban en marcha bajo el liderazgo de Agrawal.En las últimas semanas, Musk, por ejemplo, insinuó su apoyo a los estándares de código abierto para Twitter, algo en lo que Agrawal ya ha estado trabajando en la empresa. Agrawal ha estado involucrado en el desarrollo de Bluesky, un esfuerzo nacido en Twitter para crear estándares de código abierto y descentralizados para las redes sociales, desde sus inicios. En diciembre de 2019, cuando se anunció el proyecto, Agrawal dijo en Twitter que él sería responsable de encontrar el líder del proyecto y expuso una serie de posibles obstáculos para el esfuerzo, que finalizó con: ""A pesar de estos obstáculos, creemos que existe el potencial de un impacto positivo masivo para Twitter y para la sociedad"".Musk también tuiteó una encuesta el lunes, luego de que se revelara su participación en la compañía, preguntando si sus seguidores querían un botón de edición, una función solicitada desde hace mucho tiempo, aunque controvertida, para la plataforma. Y el jueves, tuiteó un meme sugiriendo que asegurarse de que Twitter tenga un botón de edición sería parte del efecto dominó de su carrera. De hecho, Twitter dijo el martes que ha estado desarrollando durante el último año una función que permitirá a los usuarios editar sus tuits y la implementará en su producto de suscripción paga Twitter Blue ""en los próximos meses"".Tampoco está claro qué tipo de relación laboral tendrá Musk, quien una vez tuiteó un meme que equiparaba a Agrawal con el exlíder soviético Joseph Stalin, tendrá con el CEO. Con su tuit sobre la formación de un ""equipo increíble"", Dorsey el martes planteó preguntas sobre si Musk estaría directamente involucrado en las decisiones operativas estratégicas, un papel inusual para un miembro de la junta. Los miembros de la junta también suelen actuar como un colectivo, en lugar de unilateralmente, como asesores de los ejecutivos, según William Klepper, profesor de administración en la Escuela de Negocios de Columbia.Twitter en un comunicado esta semana trató de aclarar que los miembros de su directorio no toman decisiones sobre las reglas o políticas de la plataforma. ""Como siempre, nuestra Junta Directiva desempeña un importante papel de asesoramiento y retroalimentación en la totalidad de nuestro servicio"", dijo el portavoz de Twitter, Adrián Zamora. ""Nuestras operaciones y decisiones diarias las toman la gerencia y los empleados de Twitter"".¿Un inversor activista?Si Musk está intentando desempeñar el papel de un inversor activista, lo está haciendo de una manera inusual.La divulgación del lunes de su participación de propiedad de más del 9% en Twitter se produjo en forma de una presentación del Anexo 13G ante la Comisión de Bolsa y Valores, un formulario utilizado para inversores pasivos que no planean impulsar cambios en una empresa. Eso pareció contradecir sus anteriores llamados a cambios en Twitter.Luego, el martes, Twitter anunció que Musk se uniría a la junta, Agrawal dijo que la compañía había estado en conversaciones con Musk durante ""semanas"" y Musk dijo que esperaba realizar ""mejoras significativas"" en la plataforma. Más tarde ese día, Musk presentó el formulario 13D más detallado requerido para los inversores activos.El enfoque de Musk también difiere del de un inversionista activista típico, que normalmente anunciaría públicamente su intención de hacer cambios en una empresa y expondría un argumento claro de por qué una empresa está infravalorada y una estrategia sobre cómo mejorar su trayectoria financiera.Si el deseo de Musk era, por ejemplo, descentralizar la plataforma (esencialmente, hacer posible que otros desarrolladores construyan sobre ella), como ha sugerido, podría haber presentado una estimación de lo que valdría ese cambio para el empresa. ""Sabes, tal vez todo eso ya haya ocurrido, pero hasta ahora no se ha presentado de esa manera en la discusión"", dijo Schlotzer.Aún así, los analistas han señalado el potencial de que la influencia de Musk en la compañía sea valiosa. Musk está ""claramente dotado cuando se trata de poder encontrar soluciones para desafíos muy grandes"", dijo el analista de D.A. Davidson, Tom Forte.Transición al tableroMusk se ha desempeñado principalmente en los directorios de sus propias empresas, aunque también es director en el directorio del conglomerado de medios Endeavour y formó parte del directorio de la empresa de instalación solar SolarCity Corporation antes de que Tesla la adquiriera.Una vez que Musk se haya unido oficialmente a la junta de Twitter, la expectativa normal sería que brinde sus consejos y sugerencias para la plataforma al equipo de gestión en privado, en lugar de compartirlos en Twitter como lo ha hecho en el pasado, especialmente a medida que aprende información de propiedad exclusiva sobre la compañía, dijo Klepper.""Él puede recomendar que la gerencia, el CEO y el equipo de liderazgo adopten una visión estratégica de la empresa diferente a la que tienen actualmente, y en muchos sentidos eso podría ser algo positivo"", dijo Klepper. Pero si ""comienza a decir cosas fuera de la sala de juntas que deberían permanecer dentro de la sala de juntas... y digamos que las acciones por una u otra razón se estancan como resultado de eso, toda la junta está sujeta a su error"".Musk tiene un historial de terminar en problemas con los reguladores por sus actividades en Twitter. En 2018, sus tuits sobre la posible privatización de Tesla dieron lugar a una demanda de la SEC y a un acuerdo que le obligaba a revisar previamente ciertos tuits sobre la empresa. (Ahora está luchando contra ese requisito).Al nombrarlo miembro de la junta por dos años, Twitter consiguió que Musk aceptara no comprar más del 14,9% de sus acciones, lo que le daría un control aún más poderoso sobre la empresa, mientras se desempeña como miembro de la junta, pero no hay garantía de que no cambiará una vez que termine su mandato. Por otro lado, podría ser un problema para las acciones de Twitter si Musk, que tiene un historial de ser capaz de provocar cambios bruscos en los precios de los activos sobre los que tuitea, decide deshacerse de su participación en la empresa por cualquier motivo.Si las cosas salen mal, podría reflejarse negativamente en Agrawal, dijo Klepper, lo que podría poner una mancha en su liderazgo al principio de su mandato. “Si bien Elon trae muchas cosas buenas a Twitter, también trae algo de equipaje”, dijo Forte.";"No está claro exactamente qué espera lograr Musk en Twitter.Pero, dijo, ""la forma en que eso está evolucionando es diferente a la forma en que evolucionaría normalmente si hubiera un activista [inversionista] que se involucrara"".A la vista del público, y tal vez incluso internamente, Musk podría tener la percepción de ser una especie de CEO en la sombra.Luego, el martes, Twitter anunció que Musk se uniría a la junta, Agrawal dijo que la compañía había estado en conversaciones con Musk durante ""semanas"" y Musk dijo que esperaba realizar ""mejoras significativas"" en la plataforma.Aún así, los analistas han señalado el potencial de que la influencia de Musk en la compañía sea valiosa.";['vida', 'twitter', 'difícil', 'el', 'la', 'que', 'los', 'nuevo', 'ceo', 'y', 'elon', 'su', 'podría', 'musk', 'una', 'en', 'hacerle'];0.011904761904761902;neutral
CNN;Nave de SpaceX con civiles llega a la Estación Espacial Internacional;"SpaceX llega a la Estación Espacial Internacional 1:43(CNN) -- Una nave espacial de SpaceX que transporta a tres clientes y a un exastronauta de la NASA llegó esta mañana a la Estación Espacial Internacional (EEI).El cohete despegó este viernes del Centro Espacial Kennedy en Florida, dando inicio a una misión única en su tipo que lleva al grupo en una misión de 10 días a la EEI.Así se vivió el despegue del cohete de SpaceX y Axiom con tripulantes civiles 1:17La nave espacial, que se separó del cohete después de alcanzar la órbita, voló libremente durante 20 horas a través de la órbita y pasó todo el viernes maniobrando lentamente más cerca de la EEI, y logró atracar en la mañana del sábado, tras resolver un problema de video.Aquí está toda la información que necesitas saber.¿Quién ha organizado la misión?El viaje fue gestionado por la startup Axiom Space, con sede en Houston, Texas, que busca reservar viajes en cohetes, brindar toda la capacitación necesaria y coordinar vuelos a la EEI para cualquiera que pueda pagarlo. Todo está en línea con el objetivo del gobierno de EE.UU. y el sector privado de impulsar la actividad comercial en la EEI y más allá.publicidad¿Quiénes componen la tripulación?A bordo de esta misión, llamada AX-1, están Michael Lopez-Alegría, un exastronauta de la NASA convertido en empleado de Axiom que está al mando de la misión  el empresario israelí Eytan Stibbe  el inversor canadiense Mark Pathy  y el magnate inmobiliario con sede en Ohio Larry Connor.Cuando llegaron a la EEI en la nave SpaceX Crew Dragon, se unieron a siete astronautas profesionales que ya estaban a bordo de la estación espacial, entre ellos tres astronautas de la NASA, un astronauta alemán y tres cosmonautas rusos.No es la primera vez que personas que no son astronautas visitan la EEI, puesto que, en años anteriores, Rusia ha vendido asientos en sus naves Soyuz. Sin embargo, esta es la primera misión que incluye una tripulación compuesta solo por civiles que viajan a la EEI en una nave espacial de fabricación estadounidense.¿Son turistas o astronautas?Esta es una pregunta que se plantea en la comunidad de los vuelos espaciales en estos momentos.Tradicionalmente, el gobierno de EE.UU. concedía alas de astronauta a cualquier persona que viajase a más de 80 kilómetros por encima de la superficie de la Tierra. Pero las alas de astronauta comercial -una designación relativamente nueva otorgada por la Administración Federal de Aviación- no se concede tan fácilmente.El año pasado, la FAA decidió poner fin a el programa de alas de astronauta comercial el 1 de enero de 2022. Ahora, la FAA planea simplemente enumerar los nombres de todos los que vuelan por encima del umbral de las 80 km en un sitio web.La cuestión de si es justo seguir llamando ""astronautas"" a las personas que pagan por ir al espacio es una cuestión abierta, y muchos observadores, incluidos los astronautas de la NASA, han opinado al respecto.No todo el mundo está preocupado por las palabras.""Si estás atando tu trasero a un cohete, creo que eso vale algo"", dijo el exastronauta de la NASA Terry Virts a National Geographic cuando se le preguntó sobre el tema. ""Cuando era piloto de F-16, no me daba envidia que llamaran pilotos a los de Cessna. Creo que todo el mundo va a saber si has pagado por ser un pasajero en un vuelo suborbital de cinco minutos o si eres el comandante de un vehículo espacial interplanetario. Son dos cosas diferentes"".Si le preguntas a la tripulación del AX-1, no les gusta que les llamen ""turistas"".""Esta misión es muy diferente de lo que pueden haber oído en algunas de las misiones recientes -especialmente suborbitales-. No somos turistas espaciales"", dijo López-Alegría a los periodistas a principios de este mes, refiriéndose a los breves vuelos supersónicos realizados por la empresa Blue Origin de Jeff Bezos. ""Creo que hay un papel importante para el turismo espacial, pero no es lo que pretende Axiom"".La tripulación sí se sometió a un amplio entrenamiento para esta misión, asumiendo gran parte de las mismas tareas que los astronautas profesionales en formación. Pero el hecho es que los tres clientes de pago de este vuelo -Stibbe, Pathy y Connor- no fueron seleccionados de entre miles de solicitantes y no están dedicando gran parte de sus vidas al esfuerzo.La propia Axiom ha sido más frívola en el uso de la palabra en el pasado.""'Vuelos espaciales comerciales'. Turismo espacial. Lo llames como lo llames, está ocurriendo. Y pronto"", escribió la empresa en su sitio web.¿Cuánto ha costado el viaje?Axiom Space reveló al principio que cada asiento valdría US$ 55 millones para un viaje de 10 días a la EEI y, en una conferencia de prensa del año pasado, afirmó que costaría ""decenas de millones"". No obstante, la startup no ha querido ofrecer más detalles sobre el dinero que ha supuesto esta misión.La misión ha sido posible por la coordinación entre Axiom, SpaceX y la NASA, ya que la EEI está financiada y operada por el gobierno.La agencia espacial ha revelado algunos detalles sobre cuánto cobrará por el uso de la estación.Solo la comida cuesta US$ 2.000 al día y por persona en el espacio. Llevar y traer provisiones a la estación espacial para una tripulación comercial supone entre US$ 88.000 US$ 164.000 por persona y día. Para cada misión, llevar el apoyo necesario de los astronautas de la NASA costará a los clientes otros US$ 5,2 millones, y todo el apoyo y la planificación de la misión que presta la NASA son otros US$ 4,8 millones.¿Qué harán en el espacio?Cada uno de los miembros de la tripulación tiene una lista de proyectos de investigación en los que piensa trabajar.Connor investigará cómo los vuelos espaciales afectan a las células senescentes, que son células que han dejado el proceso normal de replicación y están ""relacionadas con múltiples enfermedades relacionadas con la edad"", según Axiom. Esta investigación se llevará a cabo en colaboración con la Clínica Mayo y la Clínica Cleveland.En la lista de tareas de Pathy figuran otras investigaciones médicas, más centradas en la salud de los niños, que llevará a cabo en colaboración con varios hospitales canadienses, y algunas iniciativas de concienciación sobre la conservación.Stibbe también realizará algunas investigaciones y se centrará en ""actividades educativas y artísticas para conectar a la generación más joven en Israel y en todo el mundo"", según Axiom. Stibbe vuela en nombre de la Fundación Ramon, una organización sin ánimo de lucro dedicada a la educación espacial que lleva el nombre del primer astronauta israelí, Ilan Ramon, que murió en el desastre del transbordador espacial Columbia en 2003. La biografía de Stibbe en Axiom dice que él y Ramon compartieron una ""estrecha"" amistad.Durante el tiempo de inactividad, la tripulación también tendrá la oportunidad de disfrutar de amplias vistas de la Tierra. Y, en algún momento, compartirán una comida con los demás astronautas a bordo. Su comida ha sido preparada en colaboración con el famoso chef y filántropo José Andrés. Sus comidas ""se basan en los sabores y platos tradicionales de la España natal del comandante López-Alegría"", según Axiom.¿Es seguro ir a la EEI mientras hay un conflicto con Rusia?Rusia es el principal socio de Estados Unidos en la EEI y la estación espacial ha sido aclamada durante mucho tiempo como símbolo de la cooperación tras la Guerra Fría.Sin embargo, las relaciones entre Estados Unidos y Rusia sobre el terreno han alcanzado un punto álgido con la invasión rusa en Ucrania. Estados Unidos y sus aliados han impuesto fuertes sanciones a Rusia, y el país ha tomado numerosas represalias, como negarse a vender motores de cohetes rusos a empresas estadounidenses. El director de la agencia espacial rusa, Roscosmos, ha llegado a amenazar en las redes sociales con retirarse del acuerdo sobre la EEI.A pesar de todo, la NASA ha asegurado en repetidas ocasiones que, internamente, la NASA y sus homólogos rusos están trabajando juntos sin problemas.""La NASA es consciente de los recientes comentarios sobre la Estación Espacial Internacional. Las sanciones estadounidenses y las medidas de control de las exportaciones siguen permitiendo la cooperación espacial civil entre Estados Unidos y Rusia en la estación espacial"", dijo el administrador de la NASA, Bill Nelson, en una declaración reciente.

CNN;Consejos de moda para salir del encierro después de la pandemia;"ARod genera debate en las redes por patrocinar producto 1:24(CNN) -- A lo largo de la pandemia, muchos de nosotros hemos soñado con cómo sería la vida una vez que el mundo empiece a recuperarse. Mientras nos enfrascamos en nuestros conjuntos de descanso y cambiamos el maquillaje por el cuidado de la piel, fantaseamos con lo ordinario: nuestro primer corte de pelo, el próximo conjunto para una cita nocturna, el uso de lápiz labial sin que se nos corra por toda la mascarilla.En muchas partes del mundo los cierres empiezan a suavizarse. Países como el Reino Unido y Francia son algunos de los que van a reabrir con cautela en las próximas semanas, mientras que en Estados Unidos, estados desde California hasta Nueva York han levantado ya las restricciones.Y a medida que la gente se reincorpora a la sociedad, muchos de nosotros estamos revaluando nuestra relación con la moda y la belleza.Mucho ha cambiado en el último año. Las previsiones de estilo se dejaron de lado, a medida que la comodidad y la facilidad sustituyeron al glamour y la frivolidad. Pero mientras nuestra vida social se redujo, también lo hizo la presión por tener un determinado aspecto, según la psicóloga de la moda Dawnn Karen.""Antes (buscábamos) la validación externa, mirando a los que controlan la puerta para determinar lo que ponemos en nuestro cuerpo a diario"", dijo en una entrevista telefónica. ""Ahora nos miramos a nosotros mismos"".Para ayudarte a navegar por el mundo exterior, hemos pedido a cinco expertos que nos den consejos para salir del refugio contra el covid-19 con confianza.publicidadVístete con alegríaUna serie de tendencias de moda emergentes pueden relacionarse directamente con nuestra salud mental, dice Karen. La moda puede utilizarse para reflejar o levantar tu estado de ánimo, y el renovado interés por el llamado ""vestirse con dopamina"" habla de esto último. Los colores brillantes, los símbolos de caras sonrientes y el volumen juguetón pueden ayudar a ""optimizar el estado de ánimo"", según Karen.Al igual que perderse en un buen libro o ver una película alegre, llevar ciertas prendas puede representar una forma de escapismo.Señalando el actual resurgimiento de los estilos de los años 2000 y 1970, Karen señaló que vestirse con nostalgia es otra forma de curación.Los años 70 eran ""indicativos de paz, amor y felicidad"", dijo, mientras que la moda de los años 90 se definía por su ""comportamiento fresco, atrevido y despreocupado"".""Es una forma de controlar nuestro dilema actual, nuestra realidad actual, en la que no sabemos si el covid se acerca o se va, si vamos a salir de la pandemia o no"", dijo: ""¿Por qué no volver a estos tiempos?"".Pero además de vestirse para ""mejorar el estado de ánimo"", como lo llama Karen, algunos recurren a la ""ilustración del estado de ánimo"", es decir, utilizan la moda para expresar cómo se sienten. Vestirse de una manera que complemente tus emociones puede llevarte a usar ropa de descanso y prendas deportivas cuando te sientas zen, priorizando la comodidad y la calma sobre un estilo llamativo.""Hay personas que se visten para ser felices y otras que se visten para estabilizar su estado de ánimo"", dice Karen, y añade: ""Hay que tumbarse en la cama (al levantarse) y preguntarse simplemente: '¿Cómo me siento hoy? Y luego determinar: ¿Quieres vestirte para mejorar tu estado de ánimo? ¿O quieres vestirte para estabilizar tu estado de ánimo?"".Por ejemplo, si te levantas sintiéndote un poco frágil emocionalmente, ¿por qué no te vistes pensando en la comodidad? Prueba con tejidos suaves y relajantes al tacto, como la seda o el lino, y opta por siluetas que no restrinjan tus movimientos. Un vestido suelto de seda o algodón en un color alegre puede ser la solución.Explora tu lado creativoSegún Marvin Osifo, estilista personal con sede en Sydney, Australia, los hombres también se están volviendo ""más creativos"" con su moda, saliendo de su encierro con salpicaduras de color, estampados y más accesorios. También ha observado un cambio hacia marcas más aventureras, ya que los compradores hacen caso a los llamamientos de la época de la pandemia para apoyar a las empresas locales e invertir en marcas de nicho en lugar de las marcas de moda rápida más obvias.""El cierre dio a los hombres tiempo para revisar su armario"", dijo por correo electrónico. ""Entonces empezaron a pensar en (formas de) actualizar su guardarropa, con algunos estilos, colores y presentación general nuevos"".Osifo instó a la gente a alejarse de los básicos y, en su lugar, a ""ampliar sus estilos de colores o patrones, así como a abrazar nuevas prendas que no hayan usado antes"". Las camisas de fibras naturales, en lugar de las sintéticas, son una norma para los meses más calurosos, pues los materiales menos transpirables, como el nailon y el poliéster, tienden a atrapar la humedad y provocar manchas de sudor, añadió.Vestirse para las nuevas realidadesLas personas que regresan a su lugar de trabajo pueden tener que equilibrar estas consideraciones con otras normas y expectativas. Pero las cosas pueden haber cambiado notablemente desde la última vez que se preparó para el trabajo, dijo Karen, quien sugirió que la vestimenta de oficina tal como la conocemos cambiará drásticamente. ""Creo que los códigos de vestimenta serán más laxos"", dijo.""Se acabará el estilo de traje y corbata de Wall Street"", continuó, y predijo un cambio hacia el ""estilo de Silicon Valley"", con capuchas de Mark Zuckerberg y todo.La estilista Josephine Eve aconsejó refrescar lo que se sabe sobre ""el código de vestimenta y las normas"" exigidas en el lugar de trabajo. Las expectativas pueden ser ahora más relajadas de lo que recuerdas. Además de estar atento a las elecciones de los compañeros, echar un vistazo a los estantes de las marcas de moda corporativa, muchas de las cuales han adoptado elementos de athleisure, ropa de descanso y vestimenta casual en colecciones recientes, puede ayudarte a navegar por la nueva normalidad.Añadir piezas llamativas a los estilos monocromáticos es otra forma de llevar tu personalidad al trabajo, sugiere Eve. Pero siempre hay que ""adaptar los atuendos a la situación"", advirtió la estilista con sede en Sydney, añadiendo que a algunos de sus clientes les ha resultado difícil salir de su zona de confort de la moda pandémica.""Tras los confinamientos, mucha gente se quedó atrapada en una 'rutina de estilo', en la que les resultaba difícil salir de su cómoda ropa 'segura' para entrar de nuevo en territorio desconocido"", dijo Eve, y añadió: ""Todos hemos pasado por muchos cambios (debido al) covid, y el cambio realmente puede evolucionar y alterar nuestro estilo personal"".Para quienes no sepan por dónde empezar, Eve recomendó experimentar con estilos de mezclilla acampanados y rectos, con tonos neutros de moda como el crema, el avena o el chocolate, y con la ""combinación de tonos"" (llevar un conjunto del mismo color pero en tonos diferentes). Eve también sugirió despojar el armario de las prendas que ""aportan emociones negativas"".Y no solo nuestros lugares de trabajo pueden haber cambiado, sino también nuestros cuerpos. Tanto Eve como Osifo dijeron que los clientes han tenido que ajustarse a sus formas corporales cambiantes, y este último dijo que esto se aplica tanto a los que ganaron como a los que perdieron peso durante el cierre. Para las mujeres, Eve recomendó invertir en vestidos envolventes, piezas que ""rozan y no se pegan al cuerpo"" y prendas hechas con ""telas elásticas y estructuradas que tienen elastano (licra)"".""No importa cuál sea tu forma, o cómo se vea tu cuerpo en este momento, abraza lo que tienes. Y aprende a favorecer la forma y el tamaño de tu cuerpo en el momento presente, en lugar de desear y esperar ese 'cuerpo perfecto' (antes) de comprar ropa"".Maquillaje limpio y sencilloLos bolsos de maquillaje quedaron intactos durante el encierro, y muchos de nuestros regímenes de belleza se limitaron a aplicar el corrector para ir al supermercado o a las reuniones de Zoom. Incluso cuando nos aventuramos a salir de nuevo, el enfoque de ""menos es más"" puede perdurar, según la maquilladora de celebridades Joy Adenuga, que cuenta entre sus clientes a la creadora de ""I May Destroy You"", Michaela Coel.En Londres, Reino Unido, donde se ha restablecido la normalidad en las últimas semanas, la gente ha adoptado un estilo de belleza minimalista, según Adenuga. La gente opta por un ""maquillaje limpio y sencillo"", añadió, y muchas de sus clientas dan prioridad al cuidado de la piel y piden acudir a dermatólogos.""Ahora que las restricciones han comenzado a levantarse, estamos experimentando con el maquillaje de nuevo, aunque con cautela"", continuó, diciendo que había ""todavía una sensación de inquietud en el aire"".""Todavía no estamos preparadas para ir a tope de glamour por las calles de Londres"".Según Adenuga, el ""glamour natural"" está a la orden del día, con ""un énfasis en el maquillaje de ojos y un toque de color en las mejillas"".Consejos de una experta para usar maquillaje y mascarilla 1:06Adenuga recomendó utilizar cremas hidratantes con color y correctores más ligeros que bases de maquillaje de gran cobertura para los próximos meses de verano. En Londres, por ejemplo, la gente acudió a los parques con ""mejillas doradas y brillantes, complementadas con colorete"" en tonos más oscuros, como el cereza y el ciruela, así como el melocotón, el coral y el albaricoque, explicó la maquilladora.Aunque las ventas de lápiz labial se desplomaron durante la pandemia, parece que la gente vuelve a recurrir a él. El minorista británico Escentuals informó de un aumento del 85% en la demanda en mayo de 2021, volviendo a los ""niveles prepandémicos"", según la publicación del sector Fashion Network. Una tendencia similar se observa también en EE.UU., donde la empresa de investigación IRI observó un aumento del 80% en las ventas de lápiz labial en abril, en comparación con el mismo periodo del año anterior.Según Adenuga, hay que elegir tonos de labios resistentes a las manchas y a las mascarillas. Y se puede conseguir un estilo discreto con lápiz labial mate en ""tonos neutros más suaves como el marrón, el topo y el nude"", añadió.Adenuga también dijo que las cejas son ""más gruesas y naturales"" que antes de la pandemia, posiblemente debido al cierre de los salones de belleza en muchos lugares durante los confinamientos, mientras que las cejas ""pluma"" también se han convertido en una opción popular. (Adenuga dice que usar ""geles para cejas con una punta pequeña"" es la mejor manera de domar los pelos de las cejas despeinadas).Y antes de volver a echar mano de las paletas de sombras de ojos, Adenuga también recomendó realizar una ""auditoría de belleza"" de tu colección y tirar todo lo que haya caducado.Refresca y reactiva tu cabelloEn los lugares donde se han reabierto las peluquerías, los estilistas han sido bombardeados con citas para recortar los mechones rebeldes de la pandemia, o incluso para arreglar algún que otro desastre capilar inspirado en TikTok.En Hong Kong (donde el miedo al virus, más que las restricciones legales, mantuvo a la gente alejada de los salones), los clientes que regresaban a menudo se encontraban ""confundidos o perdidos"" sobre lo que debían hacer con su cabello, dijo Marvin Lin, director creativo de Shhh Salon.La investigación en línea solo puede ayudar hasta cierto punto. Consultar a un estilista profesional en persona suele ser la mejor manera de obtener recomendaciones adaptadas a la forma de tu cara y a las tendencias actuales, dijo Lin, y añadió: ""Estamos en muy buena posición para (dar) consejos"".Ella recomendó estilos más cortos, que no solo son adecuados para los meses más calurosos, sino que también te permiten literalmente ""cortar el último año"". Como el pelo suele crecer 15 centímetros al año, un corte grande ayudará a ""refrescar y reiniciar"" tu imagen, explicó.Los efectos del covid-19 en el cabello 0:50Lin fue testigo de una buena cantidad de crisis capilares durante la pandemia, muchas de las cuales se debieron a la tendencia de usar tintes en casa. Teñirse el pelo en un salón de belleza en lugar de hacerlo en nuestra bañera tiene una serie de ventajas, ya que los estilistas profesionales suelen hacer pruebas en el pelo para asegurarse de que se consigue el color exacto. Lin afirma que en los salones se toman otras precauciones para proteger el cabello y el cuero cabelludo de los clientes.""Sin esas medidas adecuadas, el pelo, la textura, se estropea totalmente y se vuelve áspero"", explica. ""Y por no mencionar que (la gente) no pudo conseguir el color que pretendía"".Lin sugirió que los que experimentan sensibilidad y daños en el cabello deberían probar una ""desintoxicación del cuero cabelludo"" para limpiar la piel sin quitarle sus aceites naturales.A pesar de los experimentos realizados con colores de neón y puntas escarchadas al estilo de las bandas de los 90, algunos de nosotros volveremos a los peinados más adecuados para la oficina en los próximos meses. Una forma de mantener la creatividad es un peinado que Lin llama ""No lo cuentes"", que consiste en teñir estratégicamente una sección inferior del cabello con un tono brillante que pueda ocultarse fácilmente cuando te dejes el pelo suelto. Las mechas en contraste son otra buena forma de hacerlo, dice.Pero, según Karen, muchas de las ""reglas estrictas"" tácitas a las que antes nos ateníamos han quedado ""obsoletas"". Tanto si llevamos color en el pelo como si nos vestimos para estar cómodos, hemos desarrollado una nueva relación con nuestra apariencia, ""y a su vez"", añadió, ""hemos desarrollado una nueva relación con nosotros mismos"".";"Y a medida que la gente se reincorpora a la sociedad, muchos de nosotros estamos revaluando nuestra relación con la moda y la belleza.Las previsiones de estilo se dejaron de lado, a medida que la comodidad y la facilidad sustituyeron al glamour y la frivolidad.""Antes (buscábamos) la validación externa, mirando a los que controlan la puerta para determinar lo que ponemos en nuestro cuerpo a diario"", dijo en una entrevista telefónica.Por ejemplo, si te levantas sintiéndote un poco frágil emocionalmente, ¿por qué no te vistes pensando en la comodidad?Lin afirma que en los salones se toman otras precauciones para proteger el cabello y el cuero cabelludo de los clientes.";['las', 'encierro', 'salir', 'para', 'la', 'consejos', 'que', 'pandemia', 'el', 'y', 'después', 'en', 'los', 'se', 'una', 'del', 'moda'];0.05595238095238094;neutral

CNN;Este hombre adquirió un crucero en Cragislist y lleva años restaurándolo;"Chris Wilson y su pareja Jin Li viven ahora a bordo del crucero que compró en 2008. Crédito: Christopher Willson(CNN) -- No todos los días te puedes encontrar un crucero en venta en Craigslist. Así que Chris Willson se sintió inmediatamente intrigado cuando se encontró con una embarcación de 89,3 metros que aparecía en el sitio web de anuncios clasificados en 2008.El crucero ""de bolsillo"", construido en Alemania, estaba anclado en el delta de California y su propietario estaba dispuesto a venderlo.Tras ver que el anuncio aparecía en numerosas ocasiones, Willson, que trabajaba en el desarrollo de viajes de realidad virtual, decidió investigar.""Me hice pasar por un posible comprador, aunque realmente no tenía ningún interés en comprar un barco"", cuenta Willson a CNN Travel.""Estaba un poco fuera de mi nivel de comodidad, por decir algo"".publicidadUna vez que hizo el viaje hasta el delta del río interior y el estuario en el norte de California y subió a bordo, Willson se sorprendió de cuán descuidado había estado el barco de 2.496 toneladas brutas a lo largo de los años.Sin embargo, cuando empezó a explorar más a fondo, se dio cuenta de que debajo de toda la ""chatarra"" que había a bordo había un barco de cinco niveles bastante impresionante.Cerrando el trato""Tiene una de las distribuciones más espectaculares de todos los barcos que he visto"", añade. ""Las escaleras son magníficas”.""Es casi lo mismo que si encontraras un viejo Corvette de los años 60 en el garaje. Puedes ver que la calidad está ahí, pero está tan descuidado que casi te sientes mal por él"".Tras investigar los antecedentes del barco, descubrió que fue construido por los astilleros Blohm and Voss en 1955, y que fue el primer transatlántico de pasajeros importante construido por Alemania tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial.Cuanto más aprendía sobre el barco, cuyo nombre original era Wappen von Hamburg, más se convencía de que era un proyecto que estaba dispuesto a emprender.Tras considerar detenidamente la magnitud de lo que supondría poseer un minicrucero, Willson elaboró un plan de restauración y decidió dar el paso.Aunque se resiste a hablar de la cantidad que pagó, dice que pudo ""llegar a un acuerdo realmente bueno con el propietario del barco"".""Lo siguiente que sé es que soy dueño de un barco"", añade Willson.Pero una vez que firmó en la línea de puntos, tuvo que pensar dónde lo iba a colocar. Afortunadamente, Willson consiguió un contrato de alquiler en la ciudad fluvial californiana de Río Vista y se encargó de remolcar el barco hasta allí.Un proyecto apasionanteFue entonces cuando comenzó el proceso de restauración. El primer paso fue deshacerse de toda la basura que había a bordo. Willson dice que había cientos de bolsas de basura de tipo doméstico junto con colchones y mantas viejas, y buscar voluntarios que le ayudaran.""Me imaginé que iba a ser un proyecto largo"", dice Willson. ""La escala del mismo era enorme. Es casi lo mismo que rehacer 15 casas tú solo"".Tras pasar unos meses viajando unas tres horas desde su casa en Santa Cruz para trabajar en el barco, Willson decidió trasladarse a bordo con su pareja Jin Li para poder centrarse plenamente en el proyecto, además de mantenerlo seguro.""Cuando me trasladé a bordo por primera vez, muchos de mis amigos y familiares no se lo creían"", admite. ""Fue un cambio de estilo de vida bastante grande. Pero yo lo veo más bien como una actualización, aunque estamos fuera de la red y funcionamos principalmente con generadores y redes solares"".Cuando empezó a indagar más en la historia del barco, Willson dice que se enteró de que, además de haber servido de inspiración para la popular serie de televisión ""The Love Boat"", fue el lugar de rodaje del cuartel general de la organización criminal Spectre en la película de James Bond de 1963 ""From Russia with Love"".El barco sirvió como crucero durante unas dos décadas, dice, y pasó por varios propietarios diferentes, así como por nombres, antes de quedar anclado en Vancouver.Tras unos cuantos pasos en falso y más cambios de propietario y nombre, fue remolcado a Alameda, California en 2005. Se pusieron en marcha planes para convertirlo en un yate de lujo, pero finalmente no se llevaron a cabo.El barco permaneció en Alameda durante varios años hasta que fue comprado por un empresario y trasladado al Delta de California. Se creía que el barco estaba a punto de ser desguazado cuando Willson lo vio anunciado en Craiglist en 2008.Buque histórico""Cuanto más aprendía sobre la historia, pensaba que podría ser una atracción en tierra, como el Queen Mary [un transatlántico retirado anclado en Long Beach que ahora es una popular atracción turística]"", explica. ""Me gustaría convertirlo en un museo y permitir que la gente haga visitas guiadas [al barco]"".Calcula que costaría unos US$ 3 millones transformar el barco en una atracción costera.Willson, que no tenía experiencia previa en barcos, ha pasado unos 14 años renovando el buque, con la ayuda de voluntarios.""Soy bastante hábil"", dice, y explica que ha reconstruido muchos autos en el pasado y que antes trabajó como ingeniero electromecánico en la recuperación de desastres.Rebautizó la embarcación como Aurora después de pasar su primera noche a bordo.""Me desperté con uno de los amaneceres más hermosos que había visto nunca"", explica Willson. ""Se formaba un efecto tipo Aurora con las nubes y el agua. Recuerdo que en ese momento pensé que 'Aurora' era un nombre apropiado"".Con la ayuda de voluntarios, junto con Li, quien, según Willson, ha desempeñado un papel fundamental para ayudar a preservar el Aurora, ha completado las renovaciones de algunos pasillos, así como de un salón y varias cabinas.""Nuestro mayor logro ha sido retirar la madera vieja de las cubiertas y dedicar una enorme cantidad de tiempo a soldar nuevas placas de acero para sellar completamente las cubiertas"", dice.""El mayor reto no es tanto el trabajo en el barco, sino lidiar con la política que hay detrás. ¿Quiere el condado o la ciudad que su barco esté allí?"".Tras unos años en Río Vista, a Willson le ofrecieron un atraque en el muelle 38 de San Francisco y trasladó el Aurora allí. Sin embargo, las cosas no funcionaron como él esperaba y más tarde se le pidió a Willson que buscara un nuevo hogar para el barco.Lo trasladó de nuevo al Delta de California en 2012, amarrando el Aurora en un puerto deportivo en Little Potato Slough, situado a unos 24 kilómetros de la ciudad de Stockton, en el Valle Central de California.Desde entonces, el Aurora está estacionado ""en aguas frescas y poco profundas"" en este lugar y parece que permanecerá así en un futuro próximo.Aunque el barco no puede navegar, Willson subraya que tiene un ""fondo sólido"" y, tras consultar con varios ingenieros marítimos, confía en que, ""con el mantenimiento y la supervisión adecuados"", pueda permanecer con seguridad donde está.""Siempre y cuando no lo saquemos donde hay mucha electrólisis y cosas así"", añade. ""De momento está a salvo, pero tenemos planes de trasladarlo más cerca de la bahía cuando esté más avanzada su restauración"".Espera recaudar fondos suficientes para sacar el barco del agua y rehacer los bajos en algún momento.Recaudación de fondos""En lo que respecta al trabajo real en el barco, he aprendido mucho"", dice. ""No hay nada que no sepa arreglar. Pero todo requiere un montón de dinero para conseguirlo"".Fuera de algunas pequeñas donaciones, Willson ha financiado él mismo la mayor parte de las obras de renovación hasta ahora.Ha podido recaudar fondos para las obras comprando artículos en mercados y subastas estatales y revendiéndolos en sitios de subastas en línea como eBay, además de trabajar como consultor en otros proyectos de embarcaciones históricas.Pero aunque estos ingresos han permitido mantener el proyecto, no son suficientes para financiar la restauración completa, y Willson está decidido a terminar lo que empezó.Tras conocer el canal de YouTube ""Ship Happens"", en el que se detallan los esfuerzos de una pareja británica que está renovando un antiguo barco de la Segunda Guerra Mundial de 80 años que compraron en eBay, Willson se animó a llevar su propia historia a la plataforma con el objetivo de suscitar interés, además de financiación.En febrero lanzó el Aurora Restoration Project, y el canal ha conseguido casi 70.000 suscriptores.""Desde que surgió todo el asunto de YouTube, hemos tenido cientos y cientos de personas que se han ofrecido como voluntarios"", dice.Willson tiene la esperanza de que su éxito ayude a acelerar las cosas, y dice que ya está viendo resultados.""Las cosas se están acelerando"", dice.Sin embargo, la producción de videos junto con la renovación de un barco está resultando complicada, y todavía está ""encontrando el equilibrio"" cuando se trata de hacer malabarismos con ambas cosas.""Una vez que empiece a sentirme más cómodo con ello, esperamos empezar a tener grupos de voluntarios que vengan varios días a la semana"", añade Willson.¿Fin a la vista?Aunque todavía queda bastante camino por recorrer, Willson se acerca poco a poco a su objetivo de transformar el Aurora en un museo.Si bien también ha pensado en transformar el barco en un hotel del tipo “bed and breakfast”, o incluso en un lugar para celebrar bodas, cree que un museo es la opción más ""realista"".""Esto es algo que intentamos devolver a la gente"", dice. ""No queremos arreglarlo y hacer nuestro propio yate privado"".Y ciertamente hay mucho que ver a bordo del Aurora. El barco cuenta con 85 camarotes, además de un salón superior con su propia cubierta privada de proa, una piscina, una gran cocina y un teatro.""Hemos restaurado un pequeño número de camarotes a bordo, pero nos quedan muchísimos por hacer y pronto ofreceremos la oportunidad de que el público patrocine la restauración de un camarote"", asegura.Willson y su equipo de voluntarios están trabajando actualmente en la parte trasera del Aurora y pretenden restaurar completamente la cocina y el comedor en lo que queda de 2022.En los últimos años, Willson ha recibido muebles de otros barcos históricos para utilizarlos a bordo del Aurora.""Tuvimos una gran donación del Island Princess, uno de los barcos en los que se rodó 'The Love Boat’, que fue desguazado recientemente"", dice.De momento, Willson disfruta trabajando y viviendo a bordo del barco, y espera el día en que pueda abrirlo al público.""No hay nada más espectacular que poder trabajar y vivir en algo tan único"", añade.Pero, ¿tiene alguna esperanza de que este espectacular barco vuelva a zarpar algún día? ""Si el dinero llega, puede volver a navegar"", dice. ""Si no, puede ser un gran museo"".";"El crucero ""de bolsillo"", construido en Alemania, estaba anclado en el delta de California y su propietario estaba dispuesto a venderlo.Tras ver que el anuncio aparecía en numerosas ocasiones, Willson, que trabajaba en el desarrollo de viajes de realidad virtual, decidió investigar.Tras unos cuantos pasos en falso y más cambios de propietario y nombre, fue remolcado a Alameda, California en 2005.""Soy bastante hábil"", dice, y explica que ha reconstruido muchos autos en el pasado y que antes trabajó como ingeniero electromecánico en la recuperación de desastres.De momento, Willson disfruta trabajando y viviendo a bordo del barco, y espera el día en que pueda abrirlo al público.";['del', 'adquirió', 'más', 'este', 'barco', 'el', 'que', 'la', 'lleva', 'hombre', 'y', 'cragislist', 'willson', 'restaurándolo', 'crucero', 'años', 'se', 'en'];0.24196428571428572;positive
CNN;Por qué la atleta Eileen Gu es la modelo soñada de la moda de lujo;"Eileen Gu responde a pregunta sobre su doble ciudadanía 1:33(CNN) -- Para los seguidores del esquí de estilo libre y de la moda, el alboroto que rodea a la atleta de los Juegos Olímpicos de invierno Eileen Gu en los Juegos de este año no ha sido una sorpresa.La actuación de la medalla de oro de la joven de 18 años en la gran competencia aérea la colocó en el centro de atención mundial este martes, provocando tal furor en China que la plataforma de redes sociales Weibo colapsó. Pero Gu ha pasado años estableciéndose como una atleta de alto nivel y una modelo muy rentable que atrae a las marcas tanto en Asia como en Occidente.En 2021, mientras ganaba medallas de oro en los Campeonatos Mundiales de esquí y en los X Games de Invierno, Gu también estaba forjando asociaciones lucrativas con casas de moda y marcas de lujo. Ha firmado para IMG Models, la agencia que representa a Bella Hadid, Kate Moss y Hailey Bieber, y firmado acuerdos con Louis Vuitton, Victoria's Secret y Tiffany & Co., así como con el relojero suizo de lujo IWC y la marca de cosméticos Estée Lauder, entre otros.De hecho, la atleta nacida en California se encuentra entre las más patrocinadas en estos Juegos Olímpicos. Llegó a Beijing con más de 20 sociedades comerciales, que van desde los auriculares Beats by Dre hasta Cadillac.Pero es el atractivo masivo de Eileen Gu en China, donde es conocida por su nombre chino Gu Ailing y ha sido apodada la ""princesa de las nieves"", lo que la hace especialmente valiosa para las marcas.publicidadHabiendo cambiado su lealtad deportiva al país de origen de su madre en 2019, la fluidez de Gu en mandarín ha ayudado a asegurar su lugar en anuncios de televisión chinos, vallas publicitarias e incluso cartones de leche (como el rostro de Mengniu Dairy, con sede en Mongolia Interior). El gigante del comercio electrónico JD.com, la cadena de cafeterías Luckin Coffee y la firma de telecomunicaciones China Mobile se encuentran entre la creciente lista de marcas del continente para las que ha modelado en los últimos meses.Eileen Gu, un ""talento único""China está en camino de convertirse en el mercado de lujo más grande del mundo para 2025, según la consultora Bain. La edición asiática de la revista Campaign, de la industria del marketing y la publicidad, estimó que los nuevos patrocinios podrían generarle a la atleta unos 15 millones de yuanes (2,5 millones de dólares) cada uno, y eso fue antes de su éxito con la medalla de oro.Según Bohan Qiu, cuya agencia creativa con sede en Shanghái, Boh Project, trabaja con las principales marcas de moda, la creciente popularidad de Gu en el país se produce en un momento en que el orgullo nacionalista en China ha visto disminuir ""la relevancia de las celebridades occidentales"".""Para esta generación, muchas de las celebridades aquí tienen una orientación bastante doméstica, por lo que (Gu) siendo mitad estadounidense mitad china y hablando ambos idiomas con fluidez, tiene un atractivo muy global"", dijo por teléfono Bohan agregando que el grupo demográfico Gen Z del país contiene ""niños de la tercera cultura"" que entienden simultáneamente los contextos chino y occidental. ""Ella es definitivamente un tipo de talento único en una década"".Gu ha combinado tratos de mucho dinero con reportajes en revistas acreditadas y apariciones en desfiles de moda de primer nivel. Visto en eventos como la Semana de la Moda de París desde 2019, desde entonces se la ha visto en la primera fila de Louis Vuitton y en la notoriamente exclusiva Met Gala, donde llegó a la alfombra roja con un vestido burbuja de Carolina Herrera.""El mundo de la moda ha ayudado a equilibrar mi formación"", dijo Gu a Vogue Hong Kong, apareciendo en la portada de la edición de julio de la revista. ""Al igual que esquiar, el modelaje requiere una expresión y una personalidad increíbles. Requiere creatividad, confianza y la capacidad de aprender y adaptarse... La transición entre el modelaje y el esquí se convirtió en un descanso y una práctica mutua que me ayudó a sentirme más motivada en cada área"".Gu también ha aparecido en la portada de las ediciones chinas de GQ y Elle. Y como editora invitada de Vogue+, la edición bimensual centrada en la generación Z de Vogue China, la atleta exploró recientemente las complejidades de su identidad bajo el tema ""cambio de código"".""Quería explorar y mostrar la naturaleza inherentemente maleable de las identidades adolescentes"", escribió Gu en Instagram, ""una cualidad que me he encontrado aprovechando una y otra vez al mostrar diferentes facetas de mí misma (atleta, modelo, estudiante, china, estadounidense, adolescente, escritora, personaje público, etc.) en diferentes entornos. Todo el mundo cambia de código y creo que es hora de que comencemos a celebrar esa naturaleza multifacética"".Gu, una ""apuesta segura"" para las marcasLas redes sociales de Eileen Gu también están llenas de moda. Ya sea publicando en Instagram o escribiendo a millones de seguidores en Xiaohongshu y Weibo (el equivalente chino de Instagram y Twitter, respectivamente), sus feeds oscilan entre el deporte y el estilo, con fotos de las pistas publicadas junto con fotos de modelos y sus últimas editoriales de moda.Su enfoque desprevenido la ha ayudado a conectarse con jóvenes fanáticos, tanto en China como en Occidente, que quiere ver ""más allá del entrenamiento, los deportes, el lado más oficial de las cosas”, dijo Qiu. ""Muchas celebridades chinas están mucho más protegidas por su agente o su representante, o tienen un difícil momento compartiendo los lados más reales de sus vidas"".Poco después de la ceremonia de apertura del viernes pasado, Gu publicó un ""lookbook"" de los atuendos que había usado en los Juegos hasta el momento. En otros lugares, ha compartido mensajes de apoyo de la supermodelo Karlie Kloss y un video viral de su equipo de desempaquetado de la marca china de ropa deportiva Anta para un desfile de moda improvisado en la villa olímpica.""Dios mío, ese chaleco y esa chaqueta de plumas emiten vibraciones de supermodelo"", escribió un usuario debajo del último video en la versión china de TikTok, Douyin. ""La princesa rana está tan de moda"", decía un comentario en otro video, usando otro apodo chino que se le dio a Gu debido al casco de esquí verde que usaba cuando era niña. ""Animándote a ser el mejor en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno"".Incluso en el fragor de la competencia, Eileen Gu utilizó su plataforma pública para impulsar sus credenciales de moda y promover la cultura china. En declaraciones a los periodistas después de clasificarse para la gran final aérea del lunes, se levantó el dorsal para mostrar a las cámaras una chaqueta negra bordada con un dragón dorado. ""Esta es una prenda que diseñé, con elementos chinos"", dijo en mandarín.El ascenso de Gu llega en un momento en que las marcas occidentales con frecuencia se encuentran sujetas a boicots de consumidores por errores percibidos, desde elegir modelos que no se ajustan a los estándares de belleza chinos hasta imprimir camisetas que enumeran a Hong Kong y Macao como países, en lugar de ciudades. Su negativa a involucrarse en asuntos políticos puede reforzar su reputación como embajadora de bajo riesgo.la esquiadora se ha mantenido en silencio sobre las muchas controversias que rodean a China en estos Juegos, incluido el supuesto trato de Beijing a la población uigur de Xinjiang y las preocupaciones sobre el bienestar de la estrella del tenis Peng Shuai.""No hay necesidad de ser divisiva"", dijo recientemente a The New York Times después de decir que ""pasaría por alto"" las preguntas sobre China. ""Creo que todo lo que hago tiene que ver con la inclusión"".Cuando se le preguntó acerca de Peng en una conferencia de prensa esta semana, Gu simplemente agradeció su asistencia y expresó su gratitud porque la tenista estaba ""feliz y saludable y aquí haciendo lo suyo otra vez"". Gu también eludió preguntas sobre si la obligaron a perder su pasaporte estadounidense, ya que China no reconoce formalmente la doble ciudadanía.Su enfoque diplomático se hace eco del de la estrella del tenis Emma Raducanu, quien también recibió elogios de los medios estatales y fue tendencia en Weibo después de ganar el US Open el año pasado. (Ella también tiene madre china y se ha dirigido a los fanáticos en las redes sociales en mandarín). Desde entonces, Raducanu ha firmado con gente como Dior, con el gerente de talentos Jonathan Shalit, y le dijo a CNN el año pasado que esperaba que ella ganara ""más de US$ 100 millones"" en acuerdos de patrocinio en 2022.Pero a diferencia de la estrella del tenis, que sigue representando a Reino Unido, la decisión de Gu de esquiar para China la convierte en un nombre aún más rentable, según Qiu.""Los héroes deportivos son definitivamente los nuevos ídolos aquí"", dijo Qiu, y agregó: ""Son héroes nacionales, lo que los convierte en una apuesta muy segura para que las marcas trabajen"".Teele Rebane y Lizzy Yee de CNN contribuyeron con esta historia.";"La actuación de la medalla de oro de la joven de 18 años en la gran competencia aérea la colocó en el centro de atención mundial este martes, provocando tal furor en China que la plataforma de redes sociales Weibo colapsó.En 2021, mientras ganaba medallas de oro en los Campeonatos Mundiales de esquí y en los X Games de Invierno, Gu también estaba forjando asociaciones lucrativas con casas de moda y marcas de lujo.Visto en eventos como la Semana de la Moda de París desde 2019, desde entonces se la ha visto en la primera fila de Louis Vuitton y en la notoriamente exclusiva Met Gala, donde llegó a la alfombra roja con un vestido burbuja de Carolina Herrera.""El mundo de la moda ha ayudado a equilibrar mi formación"", dijo Gu a Vogue Hong Kong, apareciendo en la portada de la edición de julio de la revista.Incluso en el fragor de la competencia, Eileen Gu utilizó su plataforma pública para impulsar sus credenciales de moda y promover la cultura china.";['las', 'ha', 'gu', 'la', 'qué', 'lujo', 'eileen', 'en', 'y', 'que', 'el', 'modelo', 'es', 'los', 'su', 'por', 'soñada', 'moda'];-0.052727272727272734;neutral
CNN;Ivanka Trump y Jared Kushner siguen su propio camino sobre el 6 de enero (opinión);"Mensajes de Donald Trump Jr. revelan ideas de insurrección 2:08Nota del editor: Michael D'Antonio es el autor del libro ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" y coautor, junto a Peter Eisner, del libro ""High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump"". Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario le pertenecen únicamente a su autor. Ver más opiniones aquí.(CNN) -- El reciente testimonio de ocho horas de Ivanka Trump ante la comisión selecta de la Cámara de Representantes que investiga el ataque al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021 por parte de los seguidores de su padre estuvo perfectamente “en la marca”, como dicen los especialistas en marketing, para su imagen personal. Según lo que ella dijo, también puede haber aumentado la amenaza legal que enfrentaba el expresidente y empañado aún más su legado. Sin duda, agregó un nuevo elemento a la larga examinación de una dinámica familiar enrarecida.Es notable que Ivanka Trump y su esposo Jared Kushner optaron por cooperar voluntariamente con la comisión de la Cámara que examina el intento violento de detener la certificación de la derrota de Trump ante Joe Biden en las elecciones de 2020. Esta elección los salvó de la posibilidad de ser citados y obligados a decidir si testificar bajo la amenaza de ser citados por desacato.Aunque no se ha revelado nada sobre el testimonio de Ivanka, el mero hecho de que compareciera la marca como quizás la más importante de los tres aliados de más alto nivel del expresidente para ayudar en la investigación. El segundo fue el exjefe de gabinete de Trump, Mark Meadows, quien cooperó brevemente y luego cesó. Y el tercero fue Kushner, quien también trabajaba en la Casa Blanca pero no estaba en Washington el día de los disturbios. Él, sin embargo, dio un testimonio que un miembro de la comisión calificó como ""realmente valioso"".Otras personas cercanas a Trump, incluido el exasesor Steve Bannon, el subjefe de gabinete de la Casa Blanca Dan Scavino y el antiguo asesor comercial Peter Navarro, han optado por luchar contra el esfuerzo de la comisión para que testifiquen, y el propio Trump acudió a los tribunales en un intento fallido de impedir que se entregaran los registros de la Casa Blanca. Se espera que Bannon sea juzgado en julio por desafiar la citación de la comisión. Y la Cámara votó el miércoles para recomendar que Scavino y Navarro sean remitidos al Departamento de Justicia por cargos penales de desacato al Congreso.Ivanka testificó el martes durante dos horas más que su marido, y como alguien que estuvo en el Despacho Oval el pasado 6 de enero, podría haber ofrecido recuerdos concretos de los hechos. Los miembros de la comisión están particularmente interesados en cualquier discusión sobre el tuit de Donald Trump publicado a las 2:28 p.m. que reprende al vicepresidente Mike Pence por no apoyar el plan para bloquear la certificación de la victoria electoral de Biden. También sienten curiosidad por la planificación y el estado de ánimo de su padre ese día.Es difícil imaginar que alguien en el mundo pueda evaluar mejor el estado de ánimo de Trump que su hija. Los Trump operaron durante mucho tiempo su negocio como una unidad familiar cercana, lo que significaba que ella trabajaba directamente con él. Parecía disfrutar de una latitud inusual cuando se trataba de establecer una identidad independiente.Mientras que sus hermanos adultos rara vez aparecían en la prensa, ya que se enfocaban intensamente en el imperio familiar del negocio de bienes raíces, Ivanka construyó una línea de moda homónima que comenzó con joyas con un precio de hasta US$ 25.000.Como rostro de su compañía, forjó una imagen refinada y pulida en comparación con la de su padre, y disfrutó del acceso a ciertos recintos de la alta sociedad donde él era rechazado.Pero resultó que el negocio de la joyería de alto precio había sido capturado por marcas como Cartier y Tiffany. Ivanka salió al mercado masivo con ropa y zapatos asequibles pero elegantes que fueron adoptados por las mujeres trabajadoras. Se convirtió en una mujer del pueblo, popular por su elegancia accesible, lograda cuando se convirtió en madre de tres hijos y evitó las controversias de su padre.Al comienzo de su vida de alto perfil político, trató, como lo expresó The New Yorker en ese momento, de ""flotar... inmaculada"" durante la espantosa campaña de 2016 de su padre. Hizo hincapié en que era ""una hija, no un clon"", y agregó: ""por supuesto, las hijas a menudo no están de acuerdo con las cosas que dicen sus padres"". Luego, cuando la Casa Blanca absorbió su atención, la marca de Ivanka se cerró y sus productos restantes se vendieron con descuento.A pesar de su esfuerzo por mantenerse un poco alejada de su padre, él la eligió a ella, y no a ninguno de sus hijos adultos, para un puesto de alto nivel en la Casa Blanca. (Como le dijo a un reportero, amaba a todos sus hijos, pero la describió como ""única"" entre ellos. Según los informes, también la llamó ""Bebé"").Al principio, rompió abiertamente con su padre en el mitin mortal de supremacistas blancos en Charlottesville en 2017 y en la controvertida candidatura de Roy Moore, quien enfrentó acusaciones de conducta sexual inapropiada, para el Senado de los Estados Unidos en representación de Alabama. Sin embargo, fue desapareciendo gradualmente de la vista del público hasta el punto en que, en 2019, un titular de CNN preguntó: ""¿Qué hace Ivanka Trump?"".Lo que está haciendo al cooperar con la comisión del 6 de enero es restablecerse como una figura independiente de su padre y dispuesta a responder a una consulta legítima. Esto puede deberse a una ""ruptura"" reportada con su padre, que la revista Washingtonian atribuye a los eventos del 6 de enero. También puede estar impulsada por el conocimiento, a la edad de 40 años, de que debe forjar una vida después de Washington. Hasta ahora se ha sentido frustrada en al menos un ámbito, la alta sociedad, donde ha luchado por ser aceptada.¿Cómo reaccionará el expresidente ante su elección de seguir su propio camino, incluso si corre el riesgo de lastimarlo? Teniendo en cuenta su respeto por el poder de la creación de imágenes, y que ella es a la que él llama ""bebé"", es probable que la deje salirse con la suya. Y dado que ella siempre ha sido su niña adorada, incluso podría estar feliz por ella si la ayuda a alcanzar su objetivo de volver a unirse a la élite social.";Y el tercero fue Kushner, quien también trabajaba en la Casa Blanca pero no estaba en Washington el día de los disturbios.Ivanka testificó el martes durante dos horas más que su marido, y como alguien que estuvo en el Despacho Oval el pasado 6 de enero, podría haber ofrecido recuerdos concretos de los hechos.También sienten curiosidad por la planificación y el estado de ánimo de su padre ese día.Es difícil imaginar que alguien en el mundo pueda evaluar mejor el estado de ánimo de Trump que su hija.¿Cómo reaccionará el expresidente ante su elección de seguir su propio camino, incluso si corre el riesgo de lastimarlo?;['siguen', 'jared', 'propio', 'el', 'la', 'ivanka', 'que', 'los', 'y', 'su', 'sobre', 'por', 'kushner', 'una', 'trump', 'en', 'opinión'];0.26104978354978353;positive
CNN;¿Ha cambiado tu “bucket list”? ¿Cuáles son ahora tus sueños y prioridades? (Opinión);Nota del editor: Mari Rodríguez Ichaso ha sido colaboradora de la revista Vanidades durante varias décadas. Es especialista en moda, viajes, gastronomía, arte, arquitectura y entretenimiento, productora de cine y columnista de estilo de CNN en Español. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivamente suyas. Lee más artículos de opinión en cnne.com/opinion.(CNN Español) -- Supe que el mundo había cambiado muy seriamente cuando mi amiga María —que era todo un reguilete, sin bajarse de un avión para tomar otro y gastándose lo que tenía y no tenía en carísimos zapatos y bolsos— me dijo: “¡Estoy feliz de pasarme este fin de semana descansando en mi casa! Qué maravilla no tener nada que hacer, y acostarme a ver TV, ¡y después dormir horas y horas!”.¿Feliz de estar en casa? ¿Ver TV? ¿Disfrutar horas y horas durmiendo? “Pues sí, así mismo es”, me confesó cuando le pregunté sobre su cambio de vida. “Es que mi ‘bucket list’ ha cambiado. Ya he hecho más o menos todo lo que he querido… Y lo que más deseo es mucho más sencillo, menos estresante —¡más en paz y tranquilidad!”.¡Wow! Que eso lo dijera yo no me hubiera sorprendido, porque siempre he disfrutado mis serenos momentos contemplativos pero muchas de mis amigas y amigos coinciden en confiarme que después de los más de dos años de pandemia disfrutan la vida “con mayor foco y menos deseos de momentos vertiginosos y ambiciosos”. Con más “paz y tranquilidad”.Aunque sigue divirtiéndose y lleva una vida social muy activa, mi amiga Marta y su esposo John han “cambiado algunos hábitos” —y sin hacerlo radicalmente— me dijo que está “viviendo con mejor calidad de vida, muy concentrada en cuidarme la salud. Y tanto mi marido como yo nos alimentamos mucho mejor, tomamos nuestro vino más ordenadamente (lo que para todos era obvio que ambos disfrutaban ampliamente todos los días) ¡y caminamos 20 o 30 minutos después de la cena! Y nos sentimos regios y rejuvenecidos”.Cuidando de no quedarme boquiabierta de la sorpresa —pues estos dos sibaritas no se movían para nada— les pregunto por sus planes para el verano —y me aseguran que estos incluyen “estar con familia… familia y más familia… Y pasar más tiempo con sus buenos amigos y la gente que nos quiere y realmente queremos”. ¡Otra sorpresa! Y así podría estar contándoles muchos casos entre amigos y familiares. Nuestras vidas han sido renovadas con el efecto del covid —y para muchos ha sido una excelente transformación—.Los resultados de la pandemia han calado hondo en la vida de la mayoría de nosotros y según la “coach” Megan Sam Holstein, quien escribe el blog “Seeking Truth” (“Buscando la verdad”), los editores de estilo de vida de la popular revista Country Living –y el portal español Vitonica.com– ha llegado la hora de hacer cambios positivos en nuestras vidas (¡algunos incluso muy pequeños!) –y comenzar a ser mucho más felices.¿Nuevas prioridades?Disfrutar al máximo la familia. Y la serenidad de las buenas conversaciones. La música. El cine. La moda. La naturaleza. El deporte…Y disfruta leer y releer. Y si te ilusiona volver a viajar, es el momento para planear uno que realmente sea un sueño muy especial. ¡Un supersueño! Para mí –hace unos años– fue alquilar un apartamento en París –y cuando lo hice (aunque solo cuatro semanas) realicé un sueño maravilloso que quería lograr desde muy jovencita. ¡Me sentí como una parisina 100%, comprando mi “baguette” en las mañanas en la panadería de mi barrio y saludando a mis nuevos vecinos!Y deseando realizar tus verdaderos deseos y sueños (los que no tienen que ser mil sueños, sino uno o dos que ‘de verdad’ sea posible realizar) —y sin que nada te influya ni te quite tu ilusión— establece tus nuevas prioridades y propósitos. Crea tu nueva “bucket list” (lista de cosas que quieres hacer a lo largo de tu vida) y te aseguro que será mucho más ‘posible’, sin duda alguna.¿Algunos cambios sugeridos por expertos?1.- Basta de buscar excusas —y decide seriamente mejorar tu vida. Este es el más ‘fuerte’, y quizás el más importante de los cambios que te van a beneficiar ¡muchísimo!Cambiar de hábitos es cambiar acciones diarias para beneficiar tu salud y tu vida. Unos son más difíciles —como dejar de fumar, de beber en exceso, o dejarte llevar por personas nocivas— pero son clave para una mejor vida.Y cada persona sabe perfectamente qué excusas debe dejar de usar… manos a la obra. Sin esperar.2.- Mente sana en cuerpo sano. Fabuloso cambio que no necesita explicación. Buena nutrición, chequeo médico —y caminar y caminar. Cero excesos. Y no tienes que convertirte en ‘atleta’, sino mover tu cuerpo y quererte mucho, mucho… ¡Este cambio es una verdadera delicia!3.- Reorganizar —y reorganizar—. Un cambio importantísimo —al estilo de la fabulosa experta Marie Kondo— que nos trae armonía y mucha “paz y tranquilidad” —¡y también nueva energía!Es tan positivo replantear y reorganizar tu vida y tus planes. Tus rutinas. Tu casa. Tus armarios. Tu vestuario. Tus prioridades. Este cambio —físico y espiritual— le impartirá orden al día a día de tu vida. Y creará nuevos y muy positivos propósitos. ¡Y cambiará tus más profundas ilusiones, tus sueños y el orden de tu “bucket list”! Puedes hacerlo —a cualquier edad— y te aseguro que no es tan difícil.;“Es que mi ‘bucket list’ ha cambiado.Ya he hecho más o menos todo lo que he querido… Y lo que más deseo es mucho más sencillo, menos estresante —¡más en paz y tranquilidad!”.Este es el más ‘fuerte’, y quizás el más importante de los cambios que te van a beneficiar ¡muchísimo!Es tan positivo replantear y reorganizar tu vida y tus planes.¡Y cambiará tus más profundas ilusiones, tus sueños y el orden de tu “bucket list”!;['tu', 'prioridades', 'ha', 'más', 'list', 'vida', 'el', 'tus', 'que', 'cuáles', 'la', 'para', 'y', 'es', 'son', 'sueños', 'opinión', 'en'];0.5260416666666666;positive
CNN;Rodrigo Chaves rompe el tradicionalismo en Costa Rica;¿Cuál es el estilo de Rodrigo Chaves? 0:35Nota del editor: Vaclav Masek Sánchez es un doctorando guatemalteco en sociología en la Universidad del Sur de California (USC). Recibió su maestría en el Centro para Estudios Latinoamericanos y el Caribe (CLACS) de la Universidad de Nueva York (NYU). Investiga la Centroamérica contemporánea. Síguelo en @_vaclavmasek.(CNN Español) -- Las elecciones presidenciales del domingo 3 de abril en Costa Rica se vieron como un referéndum sobre el futuro del sistema político de 70 años en la nación más estable y una de las más prósperas de Centroamérica. La segunda vuelta entre dos candidatos que registraron escasos niveles de apoyo en primera vuelta revela que el país enfrenta altos niveles de abstención electoral y un Congreso donde crecen los partidos de derecha. La victoria de Rodrigo Chaves Robles, según resultados provisionales, significa que el partido que liderará el Poder Ejecutivo no tendrá la mayoría en el Legislativo, por lo que requerirá de acuerdos y diálogos con otros cinco partidos.Las candidaturas polarizadas de José María Figueres Olsen y el presidente electo Chaves representaron dos proyectos de país distintos: uno que prometía rescatar la política de antes, mientras que el otro enarbolaba un discurso antisistema. En un contexto donde el gobierno saliente terminó con altos índices de reprobación ciudadana, las campañas centradas en ataques, más que en propuestas, no lograron convencer a los y las costarricenses para asistir a las urnas. Para gran parte de la población en general parece desvanecerse el “encanto patriótico” que resurge cada cuatro años durante las elecciones y promete, pero no logra, cambios transformacionales.Celebrada en febrero, la primera vuelta de las elecciones presidenciales ticas registró una participación del 59,71%, lo que significa el abstencionismo más alto desde 1958. Y el domingo en la segunda vuelta bajó al 56,76%, por lo que, aproximadamente, solo uno de cada cuatro votantes registrados emitió su voto el domingo por uno de los dos candidatos finalistas, fragmentando el sistema de partidos que ha mantenido a Costa Rica fuera de las turbulencias políticas de América Central, pero que gran parte de los ciudadanos parece haber llegado a considerar corrupto y fuera de contacto con los problemas cotidianos de la gente.José María Figueres Olsen, de 67 años, buscaba gobernar el país por segunda ocasión. Educado en la Academia Militar de West Point y con un posgrado de la Escuela de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de la Universidad de Harvard, Figueres Olsen gobernó Costa Rica entre 1994 y 1998, cuatro años después del fallecimiento de su padre, José Figueres Ferrer. Conocido coloquialmente como “don Pepe”, Figueres Ferrer fue una figura que definió la nación y construyó la organización política más grande de Costa Rica, el Partido de Liberación Nacional (PLN), después de liderar la facción ganadora en la breve guerra civil del país en 1948.publicidadFigueres Olsen dejó el poder a los 43 años y antes de los 50, cuando ejercía como director del Foro Económico Mundial en Davos, en Suiza, se vio envuelto en un escándalo de corrupción. El expresidente habría cobrado US$ 906.000 en 2004 a la telefónica francesa Alcatel por una supuesta consultoría que más parecía un presunto tráfico de influencias políticas para ganar contratos con una compañía estatal creada por su padre medio siglo atrás, cuando se gestaba el “milagro costarricense” Figueres Olsen negó haber cometido actos indebidos y defiende su trabajo de consultoría, y la Fiscalía desestimó la causa en 2007 por falta de pruebas. Estas nostalgias figueristas son las que en campaña el actual candidato prometió renovar y, así, regresar a Costa Rica a su época dorada.La antítesis política de Figueres Olsen fue Rodrigo Chaves, un economista de 60 años con un doctorado de la Universidad de Ohio, que regresó a Costa Rica en 2019, después casi tres décadas en el Banco Mundial (BM). Allí ascendió al rango de director como representante principal del BM en Indonesia, una importante economía en desarrollo. Allí fue sancionado por conductas sexuales impropias, luego de una denuncia de acoso sexual presentada en su contra por dos empleadas, y dejó el BM poco después. Chaves negó en varias ocasiones las acusaciones y restó importancia al asunto, al afirmar que los investigadores nunca probaron que se hubiera producido acoso sexual alguno, pero aún así recibió un veredicto desfavorable del tribunal interno del BM en junio de 2021, que lo degradó aunque sin despedirlo. La prensa costarricense también señaló a Chaves por la opacidad del financiamiento de su campaña. Estos indicios de un financiamiento ilegal generaron cuestionamientos que propiciaron la apertura de investigaciones de las autoridades electorales y penales en su contra. El partido de Chaves, sin embargo, sostiene que no hubo nada ilegal, aunque la investigación de la Fiscalía continúa.Elecciones en Costa Rica: así fue la segunda vuelta 4:30Chaves se postuló con una posición tecnocrática de fundamentos económicos liberales. Su plataforma es socialmente conservadora. Dice que está a favor de la ley y el orden y en contra de la clase política dominante. Antes de ser elegido para presidir al país, Chaves, representante del Partido Progreso Social Democrático (PPSD), ya había sido la gran sorpresa de los comicios, que contaron con 25 candidatos en la primera vuelta. Chaves pareció sacudirse los efectos negativos de haber sido ministro de Hacienda brevemente en la administración del presidente saliente Carlos Alvarado Quesada, cuyo Partido Acción Ciudadana (PAC) resultó tan impopular en la primera vuelta que se quedó sin representante en el Congreso. El PAC, nacido en 2000 con un discurso anticorrupción, rompió en 2014 el bipartidismo que gobernó durante ocho años. En los comicios del 6 de febrero, recibió menos del 1%, quedando así sin un solo escaño legislativo para el período 2022-2026, luego de haber contado con 14 en el período anterior.La apatía democrática demuestra que los costarricenses se están alejando de los partidismos tradicionales. El debate previo a la segunda vuelta fue un intercambio de descalificaciones. Para Figueres no fue suficiente apelar a su tradición familiar y partidaria  fue el discurso antipolítico y outsider de Chaves el que resultó victorioso. Ahora, Chaves asumirá el cargo bajo importantes limitaciones político-económicas. No solo no contará con una mayoría determinante en el Congreso, sino que tendrá que lidiar con los efectos de varias políticas aprobadas por el impopular gobierno saliente. En particular, el ingreso de Costa Rica a la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos (OCDE), con las diversas reformas a impulsar que esto implica  la entrada en vigor del nuevo acuerdo de 36 meses con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI)  y una nueva y muy polémica ley de empleo público que, probablemente, afectará el desempeño del sector público. Y si bien no parece haber mucho en juego en cuanto a la orientación general del modelo político y económico del país, Chaves deberá maniobrar la actual crisis económica y sanitaria, en el que seguramente será un país más polarizado y conflictivo.;0:35Nota del editor: Vaclav Masek Sánchez es un doctorando guatemalteco en sociología en la Universidad del Sur de California (USC).Recibió su maestría en el Centro para Estudios Latinoamericanos y el Caribe (CLACS) de la Universidad de Nueva York (NYU).Estas nostalgias figueristas son las que en campaña el actual candidato prometió renovar y, así, regresar a Costa Rica a su época dorada.Dice que está a favor de la ley y el orden y en contra de la clase política dominante.El PAC, nacido en 2000 con un discurso anticorrupción, rompió en 2014 el bipartidismo que gobernó durante ocho años.;['del', 'costa', 'rompe', 'chaves', 'el', 'la', 'que', 'los', 'las', 'y', 'su', 'rica', 'rodrigo', 'tradicionalismo', 'en'];0.16750000000000004;positive
CNN;Un nuevo estilo de vida: cómo es viajar por placer en 2022;"(Crédito: Mari Rodríguez Ichaso)Nota del editor: Mari Rodríguez Ichaso ha sido colaboradora de la revista Vanidades durante varias décadas. Es especialista en moda, viajes, gastronomía, arte, arquitectura y entretenimiento, productora de cine y columnista de estilo de CNN en Español. Las opiniones expresadas en esta columna son exclusivamente suyas. Lee más artículos de opinión en cnne.com/opinion.(CNN Español) -- La disminución del covid-19 en ciertos países y la proliferación de vacunas han hecho posible que comencemos a viajar más y con más confianza y tranquilidad. Personalmente me encanta: recientemente regresé de mi segundo viaje a Europa desde 2019 y me gustaría compartirles mis impresiones y consejos.Mi viaje de dos semanas me llevó a España, incluyendo Bilbao, San Sebastián, a Saint Jean de Luz en el Pais Vasco de Francia y tuvo su ""finale"" en Madrid. Un recorrido encantador, que he hecho antes varias veces pero esta vez incluía a mi hija, mi nieta de 10 años y mi yerno americano-irlandés que no conocía el norte de España.Para recordar1. Antes que nada debo comentarles que viajar todavía es muy diferente de lo que era hace poco mas de 2 años. Requiere paciencia …¡y obediencia! Paciencia cuando hay colas y las cosas se demoran un poco más. Y obediencia a las regulaciones anti-covid-19 que existen en varios países, y si las seguimos (como es el usar mascarillas, estar vacunados, etc) todo será mucho más fácil. En España, por ejemplo, me gustó notar que un gran porcentaje de la población lleva mascarillas en público y se comportan con naturalidad. Y aunque al entrar en restaurantes o cafés se las quitan para comer o beber, hay una disciplina que me gustó mucho notar. Y que al viajero imparte seguridad.2. Un nuevo consejo --muy precavido-- que me vino muy bien en este viaje: llevar varios kits de tests de covid-19 que podemos hacernos nosotros mismos, los cuales usé cuando me dio un resfriado que me preocupó. No pueden usarse como un ""test"" oficial. pero te dan gran tranqulidad y me hice uno cada dos o tres días. Pues si vives en un país que exige presentar a tu regreso un certificado de prueba, o test, negativo de covid-19, hecho 24 horas antes de embarcarte en el avión (como es el caso de los Estados Unidos), debes tomar precauciones, llevando suficientes medicinas y dinero por si das ""positiva"" y tienes que esperar a dar ""negativa"" antes de que tu línea aérea te embarque. Esto le sucedió esta semana a una buena amiga (y experimentada viajera) en Londres, donde aunque estaba vacunada y con ""booster"" (dosis de refuerzo), dió positiva el dia antes de su regreso, y se ha tenido que quedar en su hotel por 6 dias extra, hasta que ayer finalmente su test de covid-19 (hecho en un laboratorio o farmacia, los que en cada país son diferentes) dio ""negativo"" y pudo volver a Miami. Esta es una de las cosas imprevistas del ""nuevo viajar"" y las que --me asombra mucho-- muchos viajeros ignoran o no toman en consideración. ¿Una buena idea? Sacar un seguro de viaje antes de comenzar nuestra aventura, el que nunca ha sido más útil y brinda enorme tranquilidad. Y en caso de enfermarte con cuidado pueden incluir incluso el transporte a tu país en avión privado.3. Otro consejo --más cierto y útil que nunca-- es no empacar demasiado y viajar lo mas ligeros posibles. Exceso de maletas, bultos o bolsas contribuye a un caos físico (¡y emocional!) innecesario. Una sola maleta para facturar y un bolso de mano. ¡Punto! Una receta sencilla que nos ""libera"" mucho. Y en ese equipaje llevar un vestuario que podamos combinar y no nos complique la vida. No llevar 6 pares de zapatos y bolsos a juego. ¡No es necesario! Mi secreto es basar el vestuario en un color básico --en mi caso negro, o a veces azul marino-- y ""cambiarlo"" con bufandas, joyería de fantasía y ""camisoles"" de distintos colores. ¡Siempre luciremos muy bien y será mucho más sencillo! Y si no esperas asistir a una fiesta de gran gala, recuerda que unos aretes o zarcillos de brillantes o una blusa maravillosa de satén realzan tu look al instante, igual que un chal de buena calidad, como la cachemira o la seda. Lo mismo te digo con el maquillaje. Lleva tamaños pequeños en bolsas plásticas y no cargues con seis lápices labiales y cuatro blushes. ¡Dos ""lipsticks"" bastan! ¿La idea? Viajar con comfort y objetos que pesen poco, que aligeran tus maletas. Y ""aligeran"" tu viaje.El placer de viajar ha regresado sin duda, y hay que celebrarlo, pero va acompañado de ciertas precauciones y un planeamiento inteligente y cuidadoso. Nunca ha sido más delicioso viajar y conocer nuevos lugares o volver visitar aquellos que adoras, pero es necesario saber hacerlo, pues el mundo ha cambiado desde 2020, y esto requiere saber navegar este nuevo estilo de vida.";"Es especialista en moda, viajes, gastronomía, arte, arquitectura y entretenimiento, productora de cine y columnista de estilo de CNN en Español.(CNN Español) -- La disminución del covid-19 en ciertos países y la proliferación de vacunas han hecho posible que comencemos a viajar más y con más confianza y tranquilidad.Antes que nada debo comentarles que viajar todavía es muy diferente de lo que era hace poco mas de 2 años.Esta es una de las cosas imprevistas del ""nuevo viajar"" y las que --me asombra mucho-- muchos viajeros ignoran o no toman en consideración.Otro consejo --más cierto y útil que nunca-- es no empacar demasiado y viajar lo mas ligeros posibles.";['viajar', 'vida', 'placer', 'estilo', 'cómo', 'más', 'el', '2022', 'que', 'la', 'nuevo', 'las', 'y', 'es', 'por', 'una', 'en'];0.0;neutral

Lee más opinión en CNNEE.(CNN) -- Los comentarios aparentemente no planeados del presidente Joe Biden que sugieren que el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, no debería estar en el poder complican la búsqueda de un objetivo que los líderes estadounidenses y aliados probablemente favorecen, pero que es mejor no mencionar.En una parte no escrita de su discurso el sábado, en Varsovia, Biden dijo: ""¡Por el amor de Dios, este hombre no puede permanecer en el poder!"". Biden y sus asesores se retractaron rápidamente de sus comentarios, negando que el presidente en realidad estuviera pidiendo un cambio de régimen en Rusia.En cambio, el presidente dijo que simplemente estaba expresando su indignación moral por la muerte y destrucción causada por Putin. Los funcionarios estadounidenses sin duda reconocieron el daño que podría resultar de la improvisación de Biden.En el juego de ajedrez de varios niveles de la dinámica interna del poder ruso, lo último que necesitan aquellos dentro del Kremlin que podrían considerar moverse en contra de Putin, ya sea para alterar su dirección en la guerra o eliminarlo por completo, es el aliento público de un presidente estadounidense. Si el objetivo estratégico de Estados Unidos es influir en el comportamiento de Rusia, en lugar de un cambio de régimen, entonces los comentarios del presidente Biden no fueron útiles.Negociaciones, votos y otros sucesos en el margen de la guerra en Ucrania 1:53El arte del espionajeDurante más de 34 años, como miembro del Servicio Clandestino de la CIA, trabajé para persuadir a aquellos que servían bajo las dictaduras a menudo brutales de los adversarios internacionales de Estados Unidos para que espiaran para Estados Unidos. Aquellos que estuvieron de acuerdo podrían haber recibido con agrado los beneficios materiales que se obtuvieron al cooperar con la inteligencia estadounidense, pero la mayoría aceptó la compensación de mala gana.De hecho, la mayoría de estos espías acordaron cooperar con base a la disidencia ideológica con sus Gobiernos ilegítimos. Pocos tomaron los enormes riesgos para ellos y sus familias fuera del parentesco con Estados Unidos.Más bien, en sus mentes, actuaron en interés de su propio país, no de servir la agenda de lo que muchos consideraban una potencia extranjera imperialista.Históricamente, los políticos estadounidenses no han entendido que el desprecio de la gente por sus gobernantes autocráticos no se traduce necesariamente en una aceptación de Estados Unidos o sus valores políticos. Asumen erróneamente que cualquier régimen que pueda surgir de las cenizas de un déspota caído o un rival antiestadounidense compartirá nuestra agenda global o exaltará la democracia.Entre las masas en Rusia y entre las poblaciones bajo el yugo de las dictaduras en China e Irán, aunque algunos aprecian las libertades que creen que disfrutan los estadounidenses, pocos ven al Gobierno de Estados Unidos como una fuerza noble para el bien. Sin embargo, eso no significa que sus intereses comunes, cuando estén alineados con los nuestros, no ofrezcan oportunidades políticas mutuamente ventajosas.Experto militar explica por qué Putin no puede perder la guerra 2:57Preservar el poderLos rusos en posiciones de poder hoy en día no suscriben necesariamente los ideales democráticos jeffersonianos ni ven a Estados Unidos como el faro de luz brillante del mundo. Se centran en el logro y la preservación del poder y el privilegio.Por naturaleza, quienes se beneficiaron con Putin han sido oportunistas, no puramente ideólogos. Los más exitosos guardan sus cartas cerca de sus chalecos, confían en pocos, tienen cuidado de no hacer enemigos y operan dentro de coaliciones cuidadosamente monitoreadas. Para tener éxito, forjan y, cuando es necesario, abandonan alianzas basadas en intereses mutuos.Considera aquellos a quienes Putin adelantó a lo largo de los años. No lograron su patrocinio por su moral, ética o incluso mérito. Más bien, Putin empoderó y enriqueció a aquellos que leales y despiadadamente cumplieron sus órdenes. Esta red extendió su control y ganancias a todos los aspectos críticos de la sociedad, el Gobierno y la industria rusa.El líder ruso se rodeó de aquellos que, al menos superficialmente, abrazaron y repitieron su visión. Y los pocos que rompieron con él fueron aislados y castigados. Putin quería enviar un mensaje entre los privilegiados que podrían considerar salirse de la línea, ocasionalmente, uno letal. El Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos dictaminó el año pasado que el alguna vez fiel lugarteniente del FSB de Putin, Alexander Litvinenko, fue envenenado por dos agentes de inteligencia rusos que actuaban en nombre del Kremlin, una conclusión que Moscú negó.Se ha hablado mucho de los siloviki, ""hombres fuertes"", en la lengua vernácula, el término para los funcionarios gubernamentales más poderosos de Rusia y los oligarcas que alguna vez fueron miembros de los servicios militares o de inteligencia. Muchos de los más destacados vincularon sus fortunas a Putin cuando ascendió al poder. Es esta comunidad de élite, en lugar de las masas rusas, quienes hoy tienen el poder de desafiar o derrocar a Putin, y lo harían de manera más efectiva como colectivo, al menos al principio.Estos siloviki no son amigos de Estados Unidos, pluralistas de armario, ni defensores de los derechos humanos. Pero tampoco anteponen necesariamente el dogma a los intereses personales. Los cargos gubernamentales más inteligentes abandonaron cuando la Unión Soviética se derrumbó. Se beneficiaron del desmembramiento del Imperio y montaron los faldones de Putin uniéndose a su cleptocracia institucional.La nueva élite compartía la visión de su patrocinador de que EE.UU. y Occidente eran el principal adversario y competidor de Rusia por la razón más práctica: su propia oportunidad de asegurarse el poder y los privilegios.Este es el público objetivo de la presión que ejercen Estados Unidos y sus aliados. Y el objetivo debería ser alinear sus intereses con los de Occidente para facilitar la salida de Putin de su campaña ucraniana, ya sea por influencia o mediante su destitución.Los funcionarios rusos que están a favor de poner fin a la guerra en Ucrania pueden decir que están actuando porque les preocupan las consecuencias de la locura de Putin. Por el contrario, cualquier ruso que abogue por la destitución de Putin puede ser descrito como aliado o títere de Estados Unidos y la OTAN.Cualquier sugerencia de cambio de régimen por parte de Occidente faculta a Putin para usarla como un llamado a la unidad y la resistencia. Juega con el uso teatral de la victimización por parte de Putin, presentándose a sí mismo como el heroico defensor que salva a la nación de los caprichos de las potencias extranjeras hostiles que buscan destruir Rusia.Reportero de CNN cuestiona a Lavrov: ¿Por qué atacan a Ucrania? 1:05Conspiración y consenso en la política rusaUna estrategia bastante más ilustrada, sin embargo, es trabajar dentro de la naturaleza conspirativa de la dinámica interna del poder ruso. La política rusa es el negocio de la conspiración y el consenso.En su historia como Unión Soviética, incluso los líderes ostensiblemente todopoderosos e indiscutibles mantuvieron un politburó que asesoraba y ejecutaba la política. Sin embargo, cuando se desafió a los líderes, fue a puerta cerrada y se logró por consenso. Los individuos que actuaban solos tenían menos suerte.En el momento de la muerte de Josef Stalin, en 1953, el siguiente funcionario soviético más poderoso era Lavrenty Beria, jefe de la policía secreta, el Comisariado del Pueblo para Asuntos Internos, mejor conocido como NKVD, y lo que se convertiría en la KGB.Durante la lucha por el poder que siguió, Beria usó sus formidables herramientas para tomar el control, pero fue derrotado por una coalición del politburó que resultó en su muerte y la sucesión del candidato de consenso, Nikita Khrushchev.Pero Kruschev también caería en un golpe palaciego, en 1964, debido en parte a la humillación del Kremlin por la crisis de los misiles en Cuba. Kruschev fue depuesto por su lugarteniente de mayor confianza, Leonid Brezhnev, quien actuó con el apoyo del politburó.Y en agosto de 1991, fue la ""pandilla de los ocho"", una coalición que incluía al entonces presidente de la KGB de la Unión Soviética, el ministro de Defensa, el ministro del Interior y el primer ministro, que se movió, aunque sin éxito, para tomar el poder del líder soviético Mijaíl Gorbachov. Si Putin va a ser influenciado, o de hecho eliminado en el corto plazo, probablemente vendrá a manos de los más cercanos a él, operando juntos.La figura rusa más poderosa hoy en día después de Putin es posiblemente el hombre que lo sucedió en el FSB, Nicolai Patrushev, secretario del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de Rusia, un cargo vagamente a la par con el asesor de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU., Jake Sullivan, pero más poderoso. Patrushev parece tener la relación más fuerte con Putin de todos en su corte.Sus comentarios a lo largo de los años abrazan y amplifican las ilusiones de Putin sobre el poder ruso, la confrontación con Occidente y la brutal supresión de la disidencia. Pero los sentimientos compartidos de Patrushev y su participación en la resovietización de Rusia por parte de Putin no aseguran su voluntad de hundirse con el capitán y su barco.El oportunismo y la autopreservación aún podrían inducir a aquellos cercanos a Putin en las agencias de inteligencia, seguridad y componentes militares a presionarlo para que cambie su posición, o por su propia voluntad, destituirlo si no lo hace. Pero lo último que los siloviki desean que aparezcan, o lo que alguna vez serían, son aliados de EE.UU.Lo que pueden ser, sin embargo, son actores en una estrategia estadounidense y aliada más cuidadosamente escrita y bien ejecutada.";En cambio, el presidente dijo que simplemente estaba expresando su indignación moral por la muerte y destrucción causada por Putin.Se centran en el logro y la preservación del poder y el privilegio.Por el contrario, cualquier ruso que abogue por la destitución de Putin puede ser descrito como aliado o títere de Estados Unidos y la OTAN.La política rusa es el negocio de la conspiración y el consenso.Pero lo último que los siloviki desean que aparezcan, o lo que alguna vez serían, son aliados de EE.UU.;['del', 'para', 'la', 'qué', 'el', 'en', 'que', 'y', 'los', 'su', 'es', 'rusa', 'putin', 'por', 'opinión', 'élite', 'clave'];-0.11944444444444446;negative
CNN;No debemos asumir que EE.UU. frenará un ataque nuclear;¿Puede EE.UU. defenderse de un misil intercontinental? 3:44(CNN Español) -- Como en estos días deambulamos por los tristes pórticos de una posible guerra nuclear, nos llega muy a propósito el reportaje de Will Ripley, de CNN, sobre la vulnerabilidad de Estados Unidos ante un ataque con misiles armados con ojivas atómicas. Ripley se basa en una reciente investigación de la Sociedad Estadounidense de Física (APS) que afirma que sí somos vulnerables. Y eso podría significar decenas de millones de muertos en este país, en caso de guerra nuclear.De cada diez cohetes nucleares disparados desde Corea del Norte, nos alcanzarían cinco, se afirma en el reportaje. Si el ataque viene de la Federación Rusa o de China, tendería a aumentar la cantidad de impactos.La Agencia de Defensa de Misiles (MDA) sostiene, en cambio, que estamos protegidos.El lector decidirá si somos o no vulnerables. Aunque los testimonios negativos de expertos de la APS son en extremo convincentes y el contenido del reportaje de CNN nos inclina a pensar, con datos y razonamientos, que no debemos estar tan seguros ante un ataque nuclear enemigo, como nos ha indicado el Gobierno y nos lleva a creer el sentido de la superioridad estadounidense.¿Cómo empezó todo?Los intentos estadounidenses de defensa contra los Misiles Balísticos Intercontinentales (ICBM) se iniciaron en 1957 con el primer sistema del Pentágono, llamado Nike-Zeus. Después de 65 años y muchos cambios de nombre, llegamos al actual sistema de defensa contra misiles, que abarca defensas en tierra con el sistema GMD, y desde el mar con el Aegis.Preocupación tras entrevista de Peskov: ¿podría Rusia usar armas nucleares? 1:26Durante tantos años han existido al menos dos episodios inquietantes en el desarrollo de la defensa contra misiles nucleares. ¿Recuerdan a Ronald Reagan, con su Iniciativa de Defensa Estratégica rebautizada por la prensa de centroizquierda como Programa Guerra de las Galaxias, aquella fantástica táctica que incluía láseres y combates en el espacio?Pues bien, el proyecto nunca se materializó, se cerró en 1993 porque la Guerra Fría había terminado. En realidad, la tecnología apropiada no existía entonces para lograr la iniciativa de Reagan, pero parece que los soviéticos sí creyeron que los estadounidenses disponían de ella y además, agotados porque no podrían competir en aquella carrera imaginaria, se rindieron. Así que el programa de Reagan, sin disparar un cohete, cumplió ejemplarmente su objetivo. Pero sería por poco tiempo.Recientemente, Donald Trump también fantaseó con crear una defensa antimisiles infranqueable, a la que se le denominó Space Force (Fuerza Espacial). En su fundamentación se subrayaba un peligro ruso real a neutralizar para que Estados Unidos estuviera a salvo: los misiles hipersónicos. Misiles con los que la Federación Rusa cuenta efectivamente, como lo demostró en Ucrania. Washington no cuenta con ellos aún, pero se espera que en 2023 los tenga en su arsenal.Panorama actualCon estos antecedentes, la conclusión que la APS publicó tras su estudio no es nada halagüeña. Y esta es que, después de seis décadas y un gasto cercano a los US$ 350.000 millones, ningún sistema de defensa antimisiles desarrollado hasta ahora en EE.UU. (ni en otro lugar del mundo) ha demostrado ser totalmente efectivo contra amenazas realistas de misiles balísticos intercontinentales, los capaces de llevar ojivas nucleares con un alcance de al menos 6.400 kilómetros. En otras palabras, que el sistema de defensa antimisiles de Estados Unidos no puede contener totalmente un ataque nuclear ruso “serio”, especialmente, si usa misiles hipersónicos.La Agencia de Defensa de Misiles, responsable de dichos sistemas de defensa, niega la conclusión de la APS y asegura que “el sistema de defensa contra misiles ha demostrado tener capacidad medida para defender a Estados Unidos, sus Fuerzas Armadas desplegadas y a sus aliados de ataques nucleares desatados por una nación rebelde”.El estudio de la APS se refiere a los misiles balísticos intercontinentales de Corea del Norte, cuyo porcentaje de efectividad y rechazo ha sido establecida en un 50%. Pero la Federación Rusa y China tienen muchos más cohetes intercontinentales, y es de imaginar que cuentan con más organización y puntería para desarrollar esa macabra tarea. Y claro, Estados Unidos y los países atacados responderían con su ofensiva, pero las decenas o centenas de millones de estadounidenses muertos serían inevitables en esta bella nación. Así concluye la investigación de la APS mientras que la MDS mantiene su efectividad en “distinguir entre la ojiva y una nube de señuelos”.Pero ¿qué piensa, usted amable lector?;Ripley se basa en una reciente investigación de la Sociedad Estadounidense de Física (APS) que afirma que sí somos vulnerables.Recientemente, Donald Trump también fantaseó con crear una defensa antimisiles infranqueable, a la que se le denominó Space Force (Fuerza Espacial).Washington no cuenta con ellos aún, pero se espera que en 2023 los tenga en su arsenal.Panorama actualCon estos antecedentes, la conclusión que la APS publicó tras su estudio no es nada halagüeña.Así concluye la investigación de la APS mientras que la MDS mantiene su efectividad en “distinguir entre la ojiva y una nube de señuelos”.;['eeuu', 'defensa', 'debemos', 'que', 'la', 'el', 'los', 'y', 'su', 'nuclear', 'misiles', 'frenará', 'se', 'asumir', 'en', 'ataque'];0.1;neutral

CNN;‘We are failing the elephants’;Editor’s Note: CNN’s David McKenzie and Ingrid Formanek have reported extensively from southern Africa. Most recently, they covered the Great Elephant Census, which found these animals declined 30% between 2007 and 2014. Some 144,000 elephants disappeared during that period. This story is part of CNN’s “Vanishing” series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.Johannesburg, South Africa CNN —The female elephant charges through shrub, ears pinned back, silent.At least that’s how I remember it. I was 7.I’m wedged between a cousin and my father, my grandmother perched behind. We are in the back of an open pickup near the banks of the Olifants River in South Africa.“Drive!” we shout at my uncle in the cab, banging on the roof.But banging on the roof is our signal to stop.The truck stops and the elephant is right behind us. We can see the milk discharging from her teats. Her newborn is somewhere hidden in the bushes.My dad pulls out an antique double-barreled shotgun. He loads it with birdshot to fire in the air.“Don’t shoot the elephant,” my gran cries and smacks him.It would be like shooting an elephant with a tic-tac.I am crying, and so is my cousin. We smell the elephant musk  we can see the horizon through its legs.My uncle sees the elephant looming in his rearview mirror. He hits the accelerator.Outrunning the charging animal, we bounce along the dirt track. Shortly after, she turns back.We are safe. Right around the corner, the truck’s axle breaks in an aardvark hole.My family often recounts this story. And from that incident, I learned elephants had to be respected – even feared.It means no worriesImagine my alarm, then, nearly 30 years later, when I am assigned by CNN to a story in the Maasai Mara in Kenya.The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years. Great Elephant CensusThe guide drives right up to a breeding herd of elephants in the grasslands and promptly switches off the engine.“Shouldn’t we keep it on,” I say, “and maybe not be so close.”“The elephants here are relaxed,” he smiles, “Hakuna Matata.”Meaning: “No worries.”I can’t understand it. The elephants don’t charge. They do not seem agitated, as has been my experience. They completely ignore us.To be sure, elephants can be dangerous – and sometimes deadly. But in this section of the Mara, there hasn’t been hunting for decades. They are used to the tourist vehicles.The game farm from my childhood near Olifants bordered a hunting reserve to the west. At the time, they still culled elephants in Kruger National Park to the east.The elephants knew.“Elephants have a cognitive sense of where they are safe and where they are at risk,” Mike Chase, the lead scientist on the Great Elephant Census, told me on a recent trip to Botswana, where he’s been tracking elephant movements for years. The census is a pioneering pan-African aerial survey that aims to count the continent’s savanna elephant populations.“This is really the front line, this is as far as they come, they will no longer move across eastern Namibia into Angola and Zambia, fearful of the consequences of poaching,” says Chase.As poaching rises, the elephants know to stay away.And they remember.No, they don’t forgetIt’s sometimes tempting to anthropomorphize – to give an animal human characteristics – but the more I speak to people about elephants, the more elephants seem special.I met up with Chase with Ingrid Formanek, one of CNN’s most experienced field producers.Ingrid’s connection to Botswana runs deep.In 1999 she moved to Maun, on the doorstep of the Okavango Delta, to document the rehabilitation of elephants. She lived there on and off for five years.She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. Ingrid Formanek, CNNIngrid recounts the story of an elephant orphaned in the Kruger culls, called Shireni.Shireni’s handler taught her a trick: to remove her handler’s hat with her trunk and to put it on her own head and then to put it back on her handler’s. Ingrid observed as the elephant learned the behavior.Nearly a decade later, Ingrid went back and saw Shireni.“She remembered me with that simple gesture. She took the hat off my head and put it on hers. She then put it back. She made the link to that time in our lives,” says Ingrid. “”Shireni hadn’t done that in all the interim years. I was amazed, and truth be told, flattered.”Anybody who has studied or worked with elephants has their own stories about how sharp elephant memories are.Experts like Dame Daphne Sheldrick, who has rescued hundreds of orphaned calves, talks about elephants remembering people years later, and the things that happened to them – good and bad.Sheldrick speaks of elephants reintroduced to the wild who have returned years, sometimes decades, later for help with an injury or just to say “hello.”Vanishing herdsDespite their obvious emotional intelligence and survival instincts, elephants can’t escape the ravages of humans.Elephants are slaughtered by poachers who seek their ivory tusks. CNNBefore European colonization, scientists believe that Africa may have held as many as 20 million elephants  by 1979 only 1.3 million remained – and the Great Elephant Census revealed this year that things have gotten far worse.In the seven years between 2007 and 2014, numbers plummeted by at least 30%, or 144,000 elephants.As of July, Africa’s savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census. Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.And the specific cases are even more disturbing: In the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, and Mozambique’s Niassa Reserve, elephant populations have plummeted by more than 75% in the past 10 years as poachers cut down family herds, according to the survey.“When you think of how many elephants occurred in areas 10 or 20 years ago, it’s incredibly disheartening,” says Chase.“Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.”In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe. It was part of southern Africa’s “haven” that comprises 60% of all savannah elephants counted in the census.But the ivory poaching wars, driven primarily by Asian demand, are on its doorstep.Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted. Mike Chase, Great Elephant CensusBotswana is fighting an unconventional war to try to stop the slaughter, with the Botswana Defense Force mobilized throughout the border region.More than 700 specially trained soldiers are stationed in 40 bases in the far north.That protection no longer seems enough.A new memoryFrom a distance, it appears the elephant could be resting. But the smell reveals the truth.A once glorious bull lies lifeless in a dry section of the Linyanti swamp in Botswana. His face hacked off by poachers.As we approach, we see the tusks have been taken. The trunk is 10 paces from the body. The carcass is perhaps two or three days old. And it is just one of more than 20 we have counted in Linyanti in just over 48 hours.Now, with current rates of poaching, they will be wiped out from some of their range states.They could even go locally extinct, says Chase.“I’ve been asked if I’m optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Africa’s elephants,” he says, “and on days like today, I feel that we are failing the elephants.”This horrific scene could be the only way we remember them.;The Great Elephant Census found 30% of African elephants disappeared over seven years.As of July, Africa’s savannah is now home to only 352,271 elephants, according to the Great Elephant Census.Overall, including forest elephants, there are thought to be between 400,000 and 500,000 elephants across Africa.“Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.”In Botswana, elephants were long thought to be safe.Historically these ecosystems supported many thousands of elephants compared to the few hundreds or tens of elephants we counted.;['ingrid', 'great', '30', 'safe', 'botswana', 'poaching', 'failing', 'later', 'elephants', 'elephant', 'census'];0.12716082103837206;positive

Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.CNN —It’s the tallest land-based mammal in the world.Its construction-crane neck, toothpick legs, knocked knees and two-story stature make it an awkwardly lovable favorite of children’s book authors and cartoonists. This animal brings an odd sort of wonder to the savannahs of Africa.But perhaps it’s best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.The International Union for Conservation of Nature on Thursday up-listed this goofy creature – known for its craning neck, which helps it reach tree-top leaves its competitors can’t – to its “vulnerable” status, meaning the animal is at high risk for extinction.JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER/AFP/Getty ImagesIt moves up from the category called “least concern.”The reason: a sharp 36% to 40% decline in giraffe populations in recent decades.In 1985, the group said, there were as many as 163,452 giraffes.Now the estimate is 97,562.This puts the giraffe in good company. The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral – so many of the Earth’s mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.I’ve spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event that’s brewing all around the world for a CNN series called “Vanishing.” That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesIf there’s one take-away from my travels, it’s this: We can’t take species for granted.We too often assume they’ll survive one generation to the next – that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.They won’t. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford University’s Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have – at the very most – 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here – as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries.Having trouble imagining that world?“The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone,” he said. “That would be a very impoverished landscape.”It certainly would.Anthony Asael/Corbis/Getty ImagesIf you’re not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.“We are basically annihilating the life on our planet – and that is the only known life … in the entire universe,” Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. “It’s life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It’s life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don’t have the diversity of other organisms, we’re done.”What’s causing the collapse?Barnosky has boiled it all down to three words: “power, food and money.”Power, meaning we’re burning fossil fuels for electricity, transit and heat. That’s warming the planet and wreaking havoc all over the world. We’re not just talking polar bears here – amphibians, oceans, everything is affected.By food, he’s referring to the fact that humans have plowed up or otherwise altered about 40% of the Earth’s surface, he said, for agricultural production, much of it for livestock. Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land – 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard University’s E.O. Wilson – to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.ROBIN VAN LONKHUIJSEN/AFP/Getty ImagesFinally, money. That means poaching – illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin. And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.“How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where we’re living off the interest?” Barnosky asked during our interview.I’m not sure how we’ll change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development  they’re poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. We shouldn’t see the giraffe’s plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature – we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari – that we don’t realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.Imagine a world without giraffes.In the long term, without big changes, that’s what we reasonably can expect.;Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.But perhaps it’s best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.We too often assume they’ll survive one generation to the next – that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.Wilson – to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.Imagine a world without giraffes.;['extinction', 'sixth', 'world', 'nature', 'thats', 'change', 'life', 'species', 'imagine', 'humans', 'giraffes', 'planet'];0.11993243088481188;positive

This story is part CNN’s “Vanishing” series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica CNN —The “blue jeans” frog is practically screaming to be noticed. Its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. It looks like it’s wearing jeggings. But this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. It spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this Central American rainforest or rooting around in the gooey “leaf litter” of the forest floor.As such, it’s practically invisible.Unless you open your ears.Chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.“It sounds like an insect. It buzzes.”That’s Bryan Pijanowski, a “soundscape ecologist” from Purdue University and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature – especially the amphibian part – is growing exceptionally quiet these days. Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The microphones look like funny little robots – boxes with windscreen ears on each side.Researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction. CNNThe equipment has a critical mission.It’s listening for the sound of extinction.Have you heard it already? I ask Pijanowski.“I think so,” he tells me. His muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. “There is evidence all around the world.”‘Rapid extinctions’Scientists fear Earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.There have been five mass extinctions in the planet’s history.Biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in Earth's history.If we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says Anthony Barnosky, executive director of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford and author of “Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth.”“The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,” he told me, “is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.”If you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.About 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.Not good.But more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits – making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.Chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world. Joel Sartore/National Geographic/Getty Images“In the past 30 years or so, we’ve seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world,” says Steven Whitfield, a conservation ecologist at Zoo Miami who joined Pijanowski and me on the visit to Costa Rica this summer. “Many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. But other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this – places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us there’s something clearly wrong.”‘Unable to see it’Whitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.I ask him to show me how it’s done.It doesn’t take long to realize it’s not easy work. When Whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.The search begins with his ears.“I’ll hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that it’s right there and that I need to find it but unable to see it,” he tells me.Whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the EDM freak-out that is the rainforest. If you’ve been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are LOUD. I actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in Costa Rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me  and I woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (Fun aside: Researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes – because, vipers – and to watch the trees, since the “bullet ant,” which delivers the world’s most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)Whitfield’s amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. He takes me and a group of researchers from the Center for Global Soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. Our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology. John D. Sutter/CNNWhitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. There’s the “chit-chit-chit” of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the “kitten frog.” He hears the slot-machine rattle of the “glass frog,” which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. Smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when they’re threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.This place is way beyond “ribbit.” The sounds are staggering.But finding these frogs by sight?That’s more difficult.In a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.Spiders almost seem easier to come by.“Those bite,” Whitfield says, pointing to one. “Don’t touch that.”‘Something is happening’I’m grateful for the research Whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. Their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.A view from the forest canopy at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. John D. Sutter/CNNHer tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but that’s a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground – about 33 to 50 feet. She drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. She does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. She remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.“That’s pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog,” Whitfield says.His research also has helped show that frogs at La Selva are in decline.“We have really good long-term data on what’s been happening with frog populations over four decades,” he tells me. “In the forest here now, there’s only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. And for us, that’s a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we don’t fully understand what that is.”The strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog. DEA /C. DANI I. JESKE/De Agostini/Getty ImagesThat’s worth stating again.Locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.Meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.Whitfield’s search-the-forest work is critical.But even he would say it could use a technological assist.That’s where Pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.He’s listening for changes Whitfield might not be able to see.‘Your ears ring’Bryan Pijanowski is an ecologist by training. Before that, he was a “quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid” in the Midwest who also was sort of an audiophile – and an amateur musician. He played guitar in a high school band called Destruction. “Everybody wanted you to play ‘Freebird,’” he said, “so that’s what I played – over and over again.”In school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the “dawn chorus” of a swamp in Michigan. He became obsessed with nature and its music.Bryan Pijanowski is a ""soundscape ecologist"" from Purdue University. He's also director of the Center for Global Soundscapes. CNNSo he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to “soundscapes,” the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.The work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.He can’t stop listening.“There are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud,” he tells me.“It’s like being too close to the speakers at a concert. Your ears ring.”La Selva is now one of his study sites. He’s working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. His microphones have taken him to the tip of South America and the deserts of Mongolia. But this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched – and because there’s so much data. Pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. At the peak of his research, he’d installed 34 microphone sensors.Now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.He’s still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.What he’s heard – or rather, what he doesn’t hear – definitely freaks him out.‘Acoustic fossils’One evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, Pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.He visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.These charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest can’t.Take a look at this La Selva recording from 2008.2008 Spectrogram - La Selva Biological StationAnd then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.2015 Spectrogram - La Selva Biological StationHear the difference?Those are just two moments.Pijanowski’s team can compress a year’s worth of sound into one chart.Take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. The red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. The main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.A year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. Red indicates more sound coming from the forest. Blue is much quieter.It’s too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, Pijanowski tells me.But he’s frightened.“I’m worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils,” he says.“In other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. And the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.“That is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet.”A collaborator of Pijanowski’s, Michael Towsey, tells me he has a file of an Australian frog that’s thought to be extinct – a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.You can listen to that frog’s call here on the Internet.But you can no longer hear it in nature.‘Most beautiful sound in the world’Why does this matter?There’s the self-interested argument.Here’s Steven Whitfield’s take on that.“We are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. And ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. Some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. They can be painkillers or heart medicines. So these are things that can be really useful for medicine. And we’d like to not lose those. If we do lose those, it hurts us all.”Frog populations at La Selva Biological Station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to Steven Whitfield, Zoo Miami. John D. Sutter/CNNThere’s the ecosystem collapse argument.Bryan Pijanowski: “Some of the theoretical work that we’re doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. And that’s not good … You don’t wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. It could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost.”That should be enough to sway a pragmatist.Still, I think there’s a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.Chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. But when you learn about them – those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us – then it’s hard to ignore their plight.There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. We’ve helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. Climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. Pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.They are the front lines – the most vulnerable of species.Yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.Maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.After all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.One recording from the island of Borneo – called “dusk by the frog pond” – was voted by the always-wise Internet as “the most beautiful sound in the world.”It’s not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to Barnosky, the Stanford researcher. We have at most 20 years to change our ways.There’s hope. But we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. We have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. And, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.Otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.And perhaps the rest of nature, too.";La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica CNN —The “blue jeans” frog is practically screaming to be noticed.Pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica.A Mexican Treefrog at La Selva Biological Station, which is a hub for field ecology.2008 Spectrogram - La Selva Biological StationAnd then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.There are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us.;['frogs', 'biological', 'apocalypse', 'forest', 'selva', 'listening', 'la', 'frog', 'station', 'sound', 'whitfield', 'amphibian', 'pijanowski'];0.09581877447948876;neutral
CNN;Plastic island: How our trash is destroying paradise;"Midway Atoll, North Pacific Ocean (CNN) -- The distance from humanity yawns out in front of you when you stand on the pale sands of this tiny Pacific island. Midway Atoll is just about the furthest piece of land from civilization and its constant engine whir, data and jostle. Standing on the island's remote shoreline brings a calm and humility -- until you look down at your feet.On the beach lies a motorcycle helmet, a mannequin's head, an umbrella handle, and a flip-flop. They didn't fall from a plane or off a ship, and there aren't any civilians living here who could have left them behind. They were washed in with the tide, most likely from China or the US, thousands of miles away -- part of an enormous plastic garbage patch, spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which you probably contribute to. And these are just the bits of it we can see. Plastic has become a vital part of our lives of convenience. Yet the coffee cup lids, water bottles and bags we use once and throw away do end up somewhere -- in landfills, but also in the ocean. Nearly every piece of plastic ever made still exists today. More than five trillion pieces of plastic are already in the oceans, and by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish, by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually, and it's getting worse every year. Americans are said to use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour. Nothing is an emergency until you feel the burn, or see the red lights. Here plastic's impact is staring you in the face. Midway is out of sight, but again it is on the front line. Once home to the decisive battle that turned World War Two in favor of the US in the Pacific, it's now locked in a new fight.The smell of decay You have to fly to Midway at night. Only then do the millions of birds that swarm the island in high season vacate the runway. We could only get here with permission from the US government and the help of a private jet. The smell hits you first, and catches in your throat. It's the whiff of decay, of thousands of birds' bodies rotting. Part of this is nature: CNN visited the island in June -- the time of year when the Laysan albatross lay their chicks, who must learn to fly, or die. But part of it is man-made: When you tear open the fragile ribcages of the birds who did not survive -- as US Fish and Wildlife Service Superintendent Matthew Brown did in front of us -- the sheer volume of plastic waste now in our world becomes apparent. Inside the slight skeleton of one albatross, we found bottle tops and a cigarette lighter amongst seemingly endless tiny shards of plastic. It's as if plastic actually was the bird's diet. These brightly colored plastic fragments were picked out of the sea by the bird's parents, who mistook them for food, then fed them to their offspring. The birds can't digest the plastic pieces but they still feel full, which causes malnutrition and death, according to researchers. Volunteers here have an almost full-time job scooping up the corpses. kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading They have tried to clean Midway up  the huge dump of plastic trash sitting on the runway awaiting collection by boats is evidence of that. But it's almost impossible because so much washes ashore daily -- not to mention the five tons the birds fly onto the island inside in their stomachs each year, according to Brown. The Eastern Island is now littered with tiny fragments of plastic. The birds die and decay, but the plastic inside them stays forever in the sand -- a layer of man's doing that will never go away. Midway will probably vanish under rising ocean levels before the plastic decays. Albatrosses walk along a plastic-littered beach in Midway. Jackson Loo/CNN The plastic-filled stomach of a dead albatross. Jackson Loo/CNN ""These are the classic 'canary in the coal mine' scenarios,"" said Brown. ""This is an animal that relies entirely on the ocean for its survival, just like 3 billion people do. If their children, their chicks, are being impacted by plastic this much, it is simply a forbearer of what is coming for us."" From fish to plate So much of the damage is on the edge of the invisible. If you kneel down on Midway and stick your hand into the hot sand, you can pull up a troubling multicolored array of particles. These are what activists call the ""new sand"" -- plastic that has broken down into smaller and smaller pieces, and then become part of the shoreline. Are you eating your own toothbrush? Your toothbrush is one of many everyday items made of plastic. Most plastics are made from oil. Plastic production has surged in the past 50 years and could double again by 2036. 15 million tons in 1964 311 million tons in 2014 612 million tons in 2036 Billions of toothbrushs are thrown away every year. But less than 14% of plastics are recycled globally. At least 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans each year - that's one garbage truck a minute. More than 5 trillion pieces of plastic are in our oceans, weighing 269,000 tons - the same as 3,585 blue whales. By 2050, there may be more plastic in our oceans than fish. Most plastic doesn't biodegrade - it breaks down into smaller pieces, which attracts toxins... You could be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces of microplastic each year - and the toxins that come with them. Sources: Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe These smaller particles are what end up in the food chain. The smallest ones, called nano-plastics, sink deep into the ocean and can end up in plankton. Larger pieces, known as micro-plastics, float in a soup, suspended in water, and are eaten by fish. The fish then get eaten by ""apex predators"" higher up the food chain -- including humans, or the Hawaiian Monk Seal. We don't know as much as we want to about what plastic has done to these seals -- they're endangered, so there are restrictions on opening them up for study by scientists. But there are already troubling signs. Jessica Bohlander, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says the seals are acting as a ""sentinel for exposure to plastics and other persistent organic pollutants for humans."" ""A few individual animals we have seen have very high levels [of micro-plastics], particularly in adult males,"" she said. Bohlander says plastic ingestion could be causing reproductive problems for the seals -- and the bigger the animal, the bigger the concentration of plastic. ""It is very troubling,"" she said. ""With every step of the food chain, the concentration that can be measured in the tissues of animals becomes magnified.""11,000 pieces of plastic each year Seafood is essential to human life, but there is growing evidence that fish may prefer eating plastic to food. Swedish scientists recently demonstrated that larval Perch raised in waters containing micro-plastics ""only ate plastic and ignored their natural food source of free-swimming zooplankton."" This diet of plastic stunted growth rates, reduced hatching rates, and caused abnormal behaviors in the young fish, according to the study. There's also evidence that plastic is harmful to humans. The US government says styrene -- one of the key ingredients in plastic -- is probably a human carcinogen. It is studying the effects of plastic litter on marine life and plans to launch an inquiry into the effects on human health, including fetal formation. One study found that man-made marine debris may cause ""physical harm"" to humans when ingested via seafood. Another estimated that Europeans who eat shellfish could be exposed to 11,000 pieces of micro-plastic each year. What science hasn't proven yet is whether the plastic in the fish we eat directly damages our health. But it's getting there, and the case for real government concern is growing. And Midway, just by dint of its own distance and damage, is making that case. Matthew Brown told me he eats sushi much less than he used to. ""Plastics also attract other contaminants, so if you are eating food that has little bits of blue and red in there, these are attracting ... other contaminants in the ocean. This has a real impact on our primary food source.""The choice the world has made We took a boat out from the island, towards the coral reef that surrounds it. There, you can feel the awesome power of nature. Caught in the reef nearby was a sight far more troubling than the bottles we had seen float past us on the water. In one inlet was a soup of tiny white pellets. A huge piece of Styrofoam packaging had been caught, now bobbing and slowly breaking down. In its thick soup was a bottle-top, a feather, and other gunk. You could swim into it easily, let your head emerge up in its midst. Signs of resilience and defiance in nature abounded, but in one corner, man's carelessness had occupied a visible space and, perhaps for longer, an invisible one. We simply do not know what we have already done. The hardest part about the journey to Midway is the sense of powerlessness it leaves you with. The damage there began with choices -- and litter -- made decades ago. And the problem is growing, not shrinking, as humanity gets more environmentally aware. Stopping this flow of trash would require an incredible change in the daily behavior of 7 billion people. China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are considered the five worst offenders when it comes to plastic pollution, according to a study published in Science, and you can anticipate as much success telling people there to stop using disposable plastics as you would do in the US. Road test the phrase: ""I'm sorry, you can't have that coffee as you haven't brought your own reusable cup."" kilograms of plastic have entered the ocean since you started reading So what can you do? Very little, unless we all do it. You can start by bringing water bottles to work, or a reusable fork to the café, or insisting on less packaging for products. For now, the balance of convenience versus the likely risk to human health is in the favor of the coffee cup. If the science isn't there yet, public opinion won't be either.There is a tiny glimmer of hope amidst this looming disaster, one I often heard while talking to researchers, one that shows people can change. It's a recent example of something so glaringly, obviously bad for the planet -- and people -- that for centuries was accepted as a normal part of our happy, modern world. Remember smoking? We don't do that as much anymore.";Some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually, and it's getting worse every year.Americans are said to use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour.The birds can't digest the plastic pieces but they still feel full, which causes malnutrition and death, according to researchers.15 million tons in 1964 311 million tons in 2014 612 million tons in 2036 Billions of toothbrushs are thrown away every year.At least 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans each year - that's one garbage truck a minute.;['plastics', 'island', 'trash', 'paradise', 'million', 'tons', 'plastic', 'midway', 'fish', 'pieces', 'food', 'birds', 'destroying', 'ocean'];0.07700023448773448;neutral

This story is part of a CNN series called “Vanishing.” Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.Nosy Andragnombala, Madagascar CNN —It’s 2 a.m. when the half-moon wakes Hary. He senses its gravitational pull – feels the moon coaxing fish out of a nearby reef and into his fishing nets here at the edge of Africa.The 33-year-old fisherman seems to have an almost-telepathic relationship with the coral that surround this castaway island, which is little more than a heap of sand off the southwest coast of Madagascar. That relationship was passed down from his father, and it’s one held by Vezo people here.That word – Vezo – is taken to mean “at struggle with the sea,” and residents of Nosy Andragnombala define themselves by that struggle. At birth, their umbilical cords are placed in seashells and tossed as an offering into deep blue waters.They are part of the reef, and it is part of them.There’s little else: No electricity or freshwater. No industry, no jobs, no school. If you don’t know the reef – can’t feel its tides and sense its moods – then you can’t survive.And that makes what’s happening on this island all the more tragic.The reef is disappearing.Coral have started turning white and dying. No one here understands why.Local theories abound. Was it that hurricane? A chemical spill? A curse? Moake, an older neighbor of Hary’s, told me white coral snagged his fishing net one day. It spooked him, and now he won’t return to that spot. “I’ve already seen the white coral but I don’t know what’s caused it to become white,” Hary tells me. “I don’t know whether it’s something in the water that’s caused it to turn white.”Hary wakes well before dawn to cast fishing nets into the Mozambique Channel.

Sutter/CNNYet, he’s seen clues.“There’s a time when you see it,” he says. “During the hot season.”Scientists can explain the mystery of the white coral.But, frankly, I’m starting to see it as a curse, too.A curse you and I cooked up.‘And then we wept’By now, the storyline should be familiar: We humans are burning loads of fossil fuels and chopping down the rainforest, and that’s causing the atmosphere to heat up rapidly.That’s true regardless of who’s in the White House.What’s less understood is that the ocean is actually storing much of that heat.Beneath the surface, there’s evidence of a mass extinction brewing.Coral are among the silent victims, and the results are undeniable.This year, amid record heat, 93% of the Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching, the term used to describe sick coral that eject the bright-colored algae that live on them. Bleached coral turn white, and while they’re not dead, they are suffocating. The colorful algae feed the coral with the oxygen and sugar they need to survive. With prolonged or repeated bleaching, coral begin to die, eventually turning to rubble or becoming smothered by plants. It doesn’t help that adding CO2 to the atmosphere and ocean also makes the waters more acidic, and worse still for the survival of coral.The consequences are truly stunning.Research indicates nearly all the world’s coral reefs could be lost by 2050.This is just one sign of the sweeping changes we humans are inflicting on the natural world, and ultimately on ourselves. Biologists say we are on the verge of the Earth’s sixth mass-extinction event – something akin to the end of the dinosaurs. Anthony Barnosky, a researcher at Stanford, told me we have perhaps 20 years to change course – including addressing climate change – or three-quarters of the world’s species could vanish in coming centuries.Overfishing and pollution also threaten coral in Madagascar. But climate change – and the warming and ocean acidification that come with it – is expected to land the soundest blow.To stop that, we need to eliminate net carbon pollution.Basically, that means purging fossil fuels from the global economy.If we fail, there will be dire consequences.Journalists often see the end of coral through the eyes of scientists. “I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept,” Terry Hughes, a professor at Australia’s James Cook University, wrote on Twitter in April.Or we focus on losses for the tourism industry, which could be considerable.Those perspectives matter.More critical, though, are the 275 million people who depend on coral reefs for survival.Hary and Lydia are raising six children. They can't afford to send them to school. John D. Sutter/CNNThey’re people like Hary, his wife, Lydia, and the six children they’re raising.Their fates are linked to a catastrophe we are helping to cause.‘My children can’t eat’Hary stops by my tent on his midnight walk to the ocean.“Ooh-OOH! Ooh-OOH!” he calls.Translation: Get up, reporter dude. The fish are waiting.I stumble out of my sleeping bag, groggy and confused. Soon, we push off into the darkness of the Mozambique Channel in an outrigger canoe that Hary built by hand. Hary is in the back  the butt cheeks of his shorts are patched from years spent perched on the rails of the narrow boat. His second eldest son, Harizo, is up front. The 13-year-old is his dad’s professional shadow.A blood-colored moon hangs on the southern horizon. Father and son are faint silhouettes against the midnight sky and charcoal sea. The air tastes of salt, and the lull of the waves feels almost womb-like. Most surreal: The waters are bioluminescent, so each stroke of the paddle causes twinkling constellations of light to swim across the reef below us, as if mirroring the stars. The scene is exhilarating, especially for a city dweller like me.In this moment I understand how completely tied Hary is to waters around the island.As we paddle away from shore, sea melting into the distant horizon, I think about the disaster unfolding below the hull of the boat: The reef already is dying.If we don’t find anything out there, my children can’t eat. Lydia, Nosy AndragnambalaA local nonprofit called Blue Ventures has been doing scuba surveys of reef health in this area. Their divers found 70% of reefs were bleached in April, at the peak of a heatwave, which is attributed partly to El Niño but also to the warming trend we’re causing by burning fossil fuels.Hary and the other fishermen know their catch is a fraction of what it once was.“We really suffer when we go a week without catching anything,” he says.Their children cry from hunger, his wife, Lydia, tells me.“If we don’t find anything out there,” she says, “my children can’t eat.”‘Ways of the sea’Hary and Lydia’s response to the crisis? Try harder.They’re nothing if not resourceful.They moved to this island years ago because the reef on mainland Madagascar was too degraded – and because the fishing was farther away. Hary lived out here with his father as a boy, and Lydia later joined him. They’d known each other as little kids in school. Neither was able to finish, though. They had to fish.They have four kids together and care for at least two others  one is the son of a relative who died. The village is home to a few dozen people, and many depend, at least in part, on Hary’s catch for their own survival.Out here, people have to work together to make it.After putting his net in the water about 3 a.m. Hary makes it back at shore by about 5 a.m. He is out again at dawn to collect his nets, and then spends the afternoon on the water, casting a long line with 50 hooks on it into the deep ocean just beyond the barrier of the reef.In all, he spends about 12 hours per day at sea.Lydia and the kids are hard at work, too. If you walk around Nosy Andragnombala, you’re sure to see tiny children building and playing with wooden toy boats. They whittle out the hull and mast and then attach scrap-plastic sails. The kids push these little boats out onto the waves, tapping them with sticks so they catch the wind just so. When the children are about 10 years old, Hary says, they’ll be ready to fish out on the water. He won’t need to teach them to sail, though. They’ll already understand how wind and wood work together.Lydia searches reef flats near the island for octopus. John D. Sutter/CNNLike other women on the island, Lydia hunts octopus and cooks. At dusk, she boils fish on a fire while the sun sets and humpback whales perform their lumbering acrobatics on the horizon.It’s an idyllic place, but the struggle to live here is real. Several years ago, locals created an ocean reserve to protect the reef. They work with a village association to police the waters. Those efforts, combined with an intimate knowledge of the reef, make survival possible.But barely.One day, Lydia asks me, though an interpreter, if I want her to “teach me the ways of the sea.”I do, of course.I slap some $12-a-bottle sunscreen on my face, and she leads me onto the ankle-deep reef flats, a spear in her hand and a notebook in mine.‘Hara, John!’Lydia is a woman defined by brightness. Her shirt is magenta, yellow and blue. Her smile is loud and infectious, and she paints her face with a paste of mashed-up mangrove seeds, turning it orange and protecting it from the sun. Her intellect shines, too. If you duck down and follow her into her home, whose footprint is about the size of three queen mattresses and often sleeps eight, you’ll notice two pieces of butcher paper pinned to the thatched walls. On them: English words translated into phonetics and then into Vezo, the local language.“Water = oatere = rano.”“Fish = fise = fia.”“This is our octopus reserve = Dise ize ore aketapose rezeriva = Ato misy ty rezeriva horita nay.”She has been learning English in case a visitor showed up someday.“Photo, John! Photo!”Lydia points at a black urchin in the ankle-deep water. Each time she sees something new – especially spiky, don’t-step-on-that stuff, like an urchin – she gestures frantically and insists I take a photo and write down the Vezo word for the creature in my notebook.“John, photo!” A round, pink urchin.“Photo!” Some greenish blob that apparently will kill you.“Horita!”That’s an octopus, which she identifies by noticing the way the creature has arranged a pile of rocks, just so, in front of its secret den. The spot is completely unremarkable to me until she dips her spear into the hole and then twists it gently, like a baker rolling bread sticks. A tentacle emerges and wraps itself around the stick. Lydia pulls the creature out, notes that it is large enough to harvest sustainably (she won’t take small octopuses because she worries about depleting the reef  and the community has established its own reef management system to try to protect its natural resources) and then stabs the tip of the spear through its Jell-O head.A black ink cloud puddles in the water.She ties the octopus to a bright blue string and drags it like a rag doll.The tour continues.Local coral is damaged for many reasons, but climate change could deliver the knock-out punch. John D. Sutter/CNN“Hara, John!”Hara means coral.Lydia points at one piece of healthy coral in a mess of rubble, a vast expanse of reef that looks something like the ruins of an ancient city. It stretches on like almost as far as I can see, a few live coral here and there, but mostly khaki, beige and gray.It is heartbreaking to see this rubble.Especially juxtaposed against her enthusiasm.‘Don’t touch it’I struggle with whether or how to engage Hary and Lydia in a conversation about climate change and the white coral – this foreign curse that understandably makes little sense out here.How do you tell someone that factories and cars and deforestation on the other side of the world are slowly heating up the entire planet, warming the ocean, making it more acidic, and messing up reefs worldwide? It’s a tricky concept even for those of us who are climate culprits, who live in polluted cities and burn coal to pump electricity and air conditioning into our homes.Out here, there are no factories, no air pollution, no cars or roads. Lydia says she’s only been in a car once in her life, and it was to take her son to another family member’s funeral. Her son cried, she says, because he didn’t understand what was happening. Only one or two cell phones (solar powered) exist on the island, and there’s a single dusty television set. Its owner uses it mostly to play Kung Fu movies from a USB stick for the island’s kids.Yet, this is an existential crisis.To be Vezo, according to some, you have to work on the water.This place – and its culture – could vanish with the reef.I ask James Paul, a diver who surveys reefs in this area for Blue Ventures, and is Vezo himself, how he handles local conversations about climate change.It’s difficult, he says.“I tell them just be careful, it’s sick. Don’t touch it. If you touch it, it’s dead quick.”Of course, there are solutions.But if you’re on an island with essentially no carbon footprint there isn’t much you can do to prevent global warming – aside from sharing your story.Their only real hope is for us to listen.‘We’re as good as dead’I invite Lydia to sit down on a sand dune to talk about all this.I feel like the prophet of doom.I tell her that people like me on the other side of the world – people who are addicted to dirty energy sources, like coal and oil, and who drive around in cars and make things in factories that billow black smoke – have a hand in turning the coral here white.Lydia is a master at finding and identifying ocean creatures. John D. Sutter/CNNYes, there are local problems contributing to problems with the coral. The cyclone that almost killed her son destroyed some coral, and overfishing plays a role. But scientists say people like me must change or coral reefs all over the world – not just here – will disappear.She stares at me – more in disbelief than anger.Then she laughs, seemingly to cover the discomfort.“We’re as good as dead,” she says.“There’ll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white.”“It scares me, people far away are causing this,” she adds, rightly. “It’s like they’re the ones sending us this heat, which is destroying the coral. So what happens if there’s something else they do or make that causes death here?”She worries about her children. Before Hary’s mother died two years ago, some of her kids lived with their grandmother on the mainland so they could attend classes. But after she died the family couldn’t afford it, she tells me, so they had to come back to the island. (School, by the way, costs only $3 per month per child, but the family earns too little.) She wants her children to grow up Vezo – to know the ocean – but she also wants them to have options.Without an education, what other career options will they have?What happens to them if all the coral turns white?She turns to our translator and asks a question about me and a CNN videographer.“So when they go back home, they’ll teach people what they’ve learned here? They’ll tell people about what they’ve seen? They’ll tell people this is what life is like in Madagascar?”She trails off.“Maybe there are just too many cars where they’re from.”I tell her the reason I’ve come is to tell her story. And that yes, I hope that when people turn on their lights or start their cars or get on airplanes (or, most importantly, vote for public officials who care about this) that they will think about a tiny island in Madagascar.About people whose lives are threatened by the curse of the white coral.But, secretly, I worry about those of us causing the curse.Will we actually care enough to stop?Side to sideThe night after that conversation I wake up with a piercing headache.I’d been dreaming about swimming down a pristine canal that suddenly turns into an industrial wasteland.Blue water turns brown and smells of gasoline.Smoke fills the air.Nosy Andragnambala is located off the coast of Madagascar, a large island nation in eastern Africa. CNNWhen I awake, I realize the smell of gas is real. I unzip the tent and walk into a stiff wind, toward the beach. The horizon glimmers the color of peach, the first sign of dawn.Where is that smell coming from? I can almost taste the tang of gasoline in my mouth. But how can that be? There are no motors on the island.Then I see it.Our boat, with its 25-horsepower Yamaha engine.We used the motor to cut across the Mozambique Channel to this island in an hour, as opposed to the three or four or five needed to cross by sail. The irony didn’t hit me at the time. I figured we would need the motorboat to maximize the reporting we’d do.We’re as good as dead. There’ll be no more ocean livelihoods when the coral turns white. Lydia, Nosy AndragnambalaWe make these choices by default. Too often, we don’t see them or smell them – don’t actually feel the results of our actions. That’s particularly true of climate change, since the effects are both diffuse and long term. Our actions now determine the type of world Lydia’s great-great-great-great-great grandchildren will inherit. Climate change is sinister that way.There are signs of progress.We’re moving into the clean-energy era. Technology is helping.But all this is happening at a glacial pace.And it doesn’t help that US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the Paris Agreement, which aims to get the world to ditch fossil fuels and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.Will we do enough to save the coral – and so many other species?We depend on them more than we know.I walk around the boat to get some fresh air, blowing in straight from the sea.I sit down to watch the sunrise. A flock of birds hold formation in the wind. Crabs with little telescoping eyes skitter side to side in the sand. A hunk of dead coral is at my feet.We are scheduled to leave Nosy Andragnombala in a day.The scent of gasoline will evaporate then.But our mark remains.;Moake, an older neighbor of Hary’s, told me white coral snagged his fishing net one day.“I’ve already seen the white coral but I don’t know what’s caused it to become white,” Hary tells me.“During the hot season.”Scientists can explain the mystery of the white coral.Local coral is damaged for many reasons, but climate change could deliver the knock-out punch.About people whose lives are threatened by the curse of the white coral.;['children', 'hary', 'island', 'climate', 'reef', 'change', 'lydia', 'disappears', 'coral', 'white', 'ocean'];0.041073651203982944;neutral
